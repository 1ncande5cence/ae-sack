file to the current database connection . 
Database files that were previously attached can be removed using
the DETACH DATABASE command. 2. Details The filename for the database to be attached is the value of
the expression that occurs before the AS keyword.
The filename of the database follows the same semantics as the
filename argument to sqlite3_open() and sqlite3_open_v2() ; the
special name " :memory: " results in an in-memory database and an
empty string results in a new temporary database.
The filename argument can be a URI filename if URI filename processing
is enabled on the database connection.  The default behavior is for
URI filenames to be disabled, however that might change in a future release
of SQLite, so application developers are advised to plan accordingly. The name that occurs after the AS keyword is the name of the database
used internally by SQLite.
The schema-names 'main' and 
'temp' refer to the main database and the database used for 
temporary tables.  The main and temp databases cannot be attached or
detached. Attached databases use the same VFS as the main database unless
another VFS is specified using the vfs=NAME URI flag. Tables in an attached database can be referred to using the syntax schema-name.table-name .  If the name of the table is unique
across all attached databases and the main and temp databases, then the schema-name prefix is not required.  If two or more tables in
different databases have the same name and the schema-name prefix is not used on a table reference, then the
table chosen is the one in the database that was least recently attached. Transactions involving multiple attached databases are atomic,
assuming that the main database is not " :memory: " and the journal_mode is not WAL .  If the main
database is ":memory:" or if the journal_mode is WAL, then 
transactions continue to be atomic within each individual
database file. But if the host computer crashes in the middle
of a COMMIT where two or more database files are updated,
some of those files might get the changes where others
might not. There is a limit, set using sqlite3_limit() and SQLITE_LIMIT_ATTACHED , to the number of databases that can be
simultaneously attached to a single database connection. This page last modified on 2025-02-06 23:19:09 UTC
