Equivalent Recursive Common Table Expression 2. Usage Examples 1. Overview The generate_series(START,STOP,STEP) table-valued function is a loadable extension included in the SQLite source tree, and compiled into
the command-line shell .  The generate_series() table has one visible
result column named "value" holding integer values
and a number of rows determined by the
parameters START, STOP, and STEP.  The first row of the table has
a value of START.  Subsequent rows increment by STEP to a value
not exceeding STOP. The generate_series() table has additional, hidden columns
named "start", "stop", and "step" whose values are the effective
values of START, STOP and STEP as provided or defaulted.
It also has a rowid, accessible by its usual names. Omitted parameters take on default values.  STEP defaults to 1.
STOP defaults to 4294967295.  The START parameter is required
as of version 3.37.0 (2021-11-27) and later and an error will
be raised if START is omitted or has a self-referential or otherwise
uncomputable value.  Older versions used a default of 0 for START.
The legacy behavior can be obtained from recent code by compiling
with -DZERO_ARGUMENT_GENERATE_SERIES. 1.1. Equivalent Recursive Common Table Expression The generate_series table can be simulated for positive step values
using a recursive common table expression .  If the three parameters
are $start, $end, and $step, then the equivalent common table
expression is: WITH RECURSIVE generate_series(value) AS (
  SELECT $start
  UNION ALL
  SELECT value+$step FROM generate_series
   WHERE value+$step<=$end
) ... The common table expression works without having to load an
extension.  On the other hand, the extension is easier to program
and faster. 2. Usage Examples Generate all multiples of 5 less than or equal to 100: SELECT value FROM generate_series(5,100,5); Generate the 20 random integer values: SELECT random() FROM generate_series(1,20); Find the name of every customer whose account number
   is an even multiple of 100 between 10000 and 20000. SELECT customer.name
  FROM customer, generate_series(10000,20000,100)
 WHERE customer.id=value;
/* or */
SELECT name FROM customer
 WHERE id IN (SELECT value
                FROM generate_series(10000,20000,200)); This page last modified on 2023-05-01 21:49:55 UTC
