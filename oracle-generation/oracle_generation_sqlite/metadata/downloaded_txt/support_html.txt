proprietary, licensed extensions to SQLite. The SQLite Encryption Extension (SEE) will read and write database files encrypted using
128-bit or 256-bit AES. The SQLite Compressed and Encrypted Read-Only Database (CEROD) extension will read a database file that is both compressed
and encrypted. The ZIPVFS extension will both read and write database files that are both compressed and optionally
encrypted using application-supplied compression and encryption routines. The Test Harness #3 (TH3) is an alternative set of test
vectors for SQLite that verify the operation of SQLite in an
as-deployed configuration on embedded platforms with 100% branch test coverage .
