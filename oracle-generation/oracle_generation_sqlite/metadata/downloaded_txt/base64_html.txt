a loadable extension for SQLite.  The function converts a binary
BLOB into equivalent RFC 4648 text or converts RFC 4648 text into the equivalent BLOB. The base64() function is not a standard part of SQLite.
It must be loaded as a separate extension.  The source code to
base64() is in the base64.c source file in the ext/misc/ folder of the
SQLite source tree. The base64() function is not included in standard builds of
the SQLite library, but it is loaded by default in the CLI .  This
is typical of the CLI which loads various extensions above and beyond
what are available in the standard SQLite library. 2. Features The base64() function always takes a single argument. If the argument to base64() is a BLOB, then the return value is TEXT
that is the RFC 4648 encoding
of that BLOB. If the argument to base64() is base64 TEXT then the return value is
a BLOB that is the binary data corresponding to that base64 TEXT. If the argument to base64() is NULL, then NULL is returned. An error is raised if the argument to base64() is something other than
TEXT, BLOB, or NULL. If the argument is TEXT, leading and trailing whitespace is ignored. If the argument is TEXT that has a prefix that looks like base64 but contains
non-base64 characters, then as much of the input as possible is translated into
a BLOB and that BLOB is returned. The base64() function uses the standard RFC 4648 alphabet:
"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/". 3. See Also Build-in SQL functions hex() and unhex() . Extension function base85() . This page last modified on 2024-09-20 17:36:26 UTC
