Template (1) is
used for generic source-code products and templates (2) is used for source-code
products that are generally only useful on unix-like platforms.  Template (3)
is used for precompiled binaries products.  Template (4) is used for
unofficial pre-release "snapshots" of source code. The version is encoded so that filenames sort in order of
increasing version number when viewed using "ls".  For version 3.X.Y the
filename encoding is 3XXYY00.  For branch version 3.X.Y.Z, the encoding is
3XXYYZZ. The date in template (4) is of the form: YYYYMMDDHHMM For convenient, script-driven extraction of the downloadable
file URLs and associated information, an HTML comment is embedded
in this page's source. Its first line (sans leading tag) reads: Download product data for scripts to read Its subsequent lines comprise a CSV table with this column header: PRODUCT,VERSION,RELATIVE-URL,SIZE-IN-BYTES,SHA3-HASH The column header and following data lines have no leading space.
The PRODUCT column is a constant value ("PRODUCT") for convenient
regular expression matching. Other columns are self-explanatory.
This format will remain stable except for possible new columns
appended to the right of older columns. Source Code Repositories The SQLite source code is maintained in three geographically-dispersed
self-synchronizing Fossil repositories that are
available for anonymous read-only access.  Anyone can
view the repository contents and download historical versions
of individual files or ZIP archives of historical check-ins.
You can also clone the entire repository . See the How To Compile SQLite page for additional information
on how to use the raw SQLite source code.
Note that a recent version of Tcl is required in order to build from the repository sources.
The amalgamation source code files
(the "sqlite3.c" and "sqlite3.h" files) build products and are
not contained in raw source code tree. https://sqlite.org/src (Dallas) https://www2.sqlite.org/src (Newark) https://www3.sqlite.org/src (San Francisco) There is a GitHub mirror at https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/ The documentation is maintained in separate Fossil repositories located
