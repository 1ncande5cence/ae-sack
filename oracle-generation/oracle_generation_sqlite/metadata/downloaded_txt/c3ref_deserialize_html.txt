  sqlite3 *db,            /* The database connection */
  const char *zSchema,    /* Which DB to reopen with the deserialization */
  unsigned char *pData,   /* The serialized database content */
  sqlite3_int64 szDb,     /* Number of bytes in the deserialization */
  sqlite3_int64 szBuf,    /* Total size of buffer pData[] */
  unsigned mFlags         /* Zero or more SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_* flags */
); The sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F) interface causes the database connection D to disconnect from database S and then
reopen S as an in-memory database based on the serialization contained
in P.  The serialized database P is N bytes in size.  M is the size of
the buffer P, which might be larger than N.  If M is larger than N, and
the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_READONLY bit is not set in F, then SQLite is
permitted to add content to the in-memory database as long as the total
size does not exceed M bytes. If the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_FREEONCLOSE bit is set in F, then SQLite will
invoke sqlite3_free() on the serialization buffer when the database
connection closes.  If the SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_RESIZEABLE bit is set, then
SQLite will try to increase the buffer size using sqlite3_realloc64()
if writes on the database cause it to grow larger than M bytes. Applications must not modify the buffer P or invalidate it before
the database connection D is closed. The sqlite3_deserialize() interface will fail with SQLITE_BUSY if the
database is currently in a read transaction or is involved in a backup
operation. It is not possible to deserialize into the TEMP database.  If the
S argument to sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F) is "temp" then the
function returns SQLITE_ERROR. The deserialized database should not be in WAL mode .  If the database
is in WAL mode, then any attempt to use the database file will result
in an SQLITE_CANTOPEN error.  The application can set the file format version numbers (bytes 18 and 19) of the input database P
to 0x01 prior to invoking sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F) to force the
database file into rollback mode and work around this limitation. If sqlite3_deserialize(D,S,P,N,M,F) fails for any reason and if the
SQLITE_DESERIALIZE_FREEONCLOSE bit is set in argument F, then sqlite3_free() is invoked on argument P prior to returning. This interface is omitted if SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE_OMIT_DESERIALIZE option. See also lists of Objects , Constants , and Functions .
