export default {foo, summary, baz, hello, fetch, hash}; Directives Syntax: js_body_filter function | module.function [ buffer_type = string | buffer ]; Default: — Context: location , if in location , limit_except This directive appeared in version 0.5.2. Sets an njs function as a response body filter.
The filter function is called for each data chunk of a response body
with the following arguments: r the HTTP request object data the incoming data chunk,
may be a string or Buffer
depending on the buffer_type value,
by default is a string.
Since 0.8.5 , the data value is implicitly converted to a valid UTF-8 string
by default.
For binary data, the buffer_type value
should be set to buffer . flags an object with the following properties: last a boolean value, true if data is a last buffer. The filter function can pass its own modified version
of the input data chunk to the next body filter by calling r.sendBuffer() .
For example, to transform all the lowercase letters in the response body: function filter(r, data, flags) {
    r.sendBuffer(data.toLowerCase(), flags);
} If the filter function changes the length of the response body, the
“Content-Length” response header (if present) should be cleared
in js_header_filter to enforce chunked transfer encoding: example.conf:
 location /foo {
     # proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;

    js_header_filter main.clear_content_length;
    js_body_filter   main.filter;
 }

example.js:
 function clear_content_length(r) {
     delete r.headersOut['Content-Length'];
 } To stop filtering and pass the data chunks to the client
without calling js_body_filter , r.done() can be used.
For example, to prepend some data to the response body: function prepend(r, data, flags) {
    r.sendBuffer("XXX");
    r.sendBuffer(data, flags);
    r.done();
} As the js_body_filter handler
returns its result immediately, it supports
only synchronous operations.
Thus, asynchronous operations such as r.subrequest() or setTimeout() are not supported. The directive can be specified inside the if block
since 0.7.7 . Syntax: js_content function | module.function ; Default: — Context: location , if in location , limit_except Sets an njs function as a location content handler.
Since 0.4.0 ,
a module function can be referenced. The directive can be specified inside the if block
since 0.7.7 . Syntax: js_context_reuse number ; Default: js_context_reuse 128; Context: http , server , location This directive appeared in version 0.8.6. Sets a maximum number of JS context to be reused for QuickJS engine .
Each context is used for a single request.
The finished context is put into a pool of reusable contexts.
If the pool is full, the context is destroyed. Syntax: js_engine njs | qjs ; Default: js_engine njs; Context: http , server , location This directive appeared in version 0.8.6. Sets a JavaScript engine to be used for njs scripts.
The njs parameter sets the njs engine, also used by default.
The qjs parameter sets the QuickJS engine. Syntax: js_fetch_buffer_size size ; Default: js_fetch_buffer_size 16k; Context: http , server , location This directive appeared in version 0.7.4. Sets the size of the buffer used for reading and writing
with Fetch API . Syntax: js_fetch_ciphers ciphers ; Default: js_fetch_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5; Context: http , server , location This directive appeared in version 0.7.0. Specifies the enabled ciphers for HTTPS requests
with Fetch API .
The ciphers are specified in the format understood by the
OpenSSL library. The full list can be viewed using the
“ openssl ciphers ” command. Syntax: js_fetch_max_response_buffer_size size ; Default: js_fetch_max_response_buffer_size 1m; Context: http , server , location This directive appeared in version 0.7.4. Sets the maximum size of the response received
with Fetch API . Syntax: js_fetch_protocols [ TLSv1 ]
    [ TLSv1.1 ]
    [ TLSv1.2 ]
    [ TLSv1.3 ]; Default: js_fetch_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; Context: http , server , location This directive appeared in version 0.7.0. Enables the specified protocols for HTTPS requests
with Fetch API . Syntax: js_fetch_timeout time ; Default: js_fetch_timeout 60s; Context: http , server , location This directive appeared in version 0.7.4. Defines a timeout for reading and writing
for Fetch API .
The timeout is set only between two successive read/write operations,
not for the whole response.
If no data is transmitted within this time, the connection is closed. Syntax: js_fetch_trusted_certificate file ; Default: — Context: http , server , location This directive appeared in version 0.7.0. Specifies a file with trusted CA certificates in the PEM format
used to verify the HTTPS certificate
with Fetch API . Syntax: js_fetch_verify on | off ; Default: js_fetch_verify on; Context: http , server , location This directive appeared in version 0.7.4. Enables or disables verification of the HTTPS server certificate
with Fetch API . Syntax: js_fetch_verify_depth number ; Default: js_fetch_verify_depth 100; Context: http , server , location This directive appeared in version 0.7.0. Sets the verification depth in the HTTPS server certificates chain
with Fetch API . Syntax: js_header_filter function | module.function ; Default: — Context: location , if in location , limit_except This directive appeared in version 0.5.1. Sets an njs function as a response header filter.
The directive allows changing arbitrary header fields of a response header. As the js_header_filter handler
returns its result immediately, it supports
only synchronous operations.
Thus, asynchronous operations such as r.subrequest() or setTimeout() are not supported. The directive can be specified inside the if block
since 0.7.7 . Syntax: js_import module.js | export_name from module.js ; Default: — Context: http , server , location This directive appeared in version 0.4.0. Imports a module that implements location and variable handlers in njs.
The export_name is used as a namespace
to access module functions.
If the export_name is not specified,
the module name will be used as a namespace. js_import http.js; Here, the module name http is used as a namespace
while accessing exports.
If the imported module exports foo() , http.foo is used to refer to it. Several js_import directives can be specified. The directive can be specified on the server and location level
since 0.7.7 . Syntax: js_include file ; Default: — Context: http Specifies a file that implements location and variable handlers in njs: nginx.conf:
js_include http.js;
location   /version {
    js_content version;
}

http.js:
function version(r) {
    r.return(200, njs.version);
} The directive was made obsolete in version 0.4.0 and was removed in version 0.7.1 .
The js_import directive should be used instead. Syntax: js_path path ; Default: — Context: http , server , location This directive appeared in version 0.3.0. Sets an additional path for njs modules. The directive can be specified on the server and location level
since 0.7.7 . Syntax: js_periodic function | module.function [ interval = time ]
        [ jitter = number ]
        [ worker_affinity = mask ]; Default: — Context: location This directive appeared in version 0.8.1. Specifies a content handler to run at regular interval.
The handler receives a session object as its first argument,
it also has access to global objects such as ngx . The optional interval parameter
sets the interval between two consecutive runs,
by default, 5 seconds. The optional jitter parameter sets the time within which
the location content handler will be randomly delayed,
by default, there is no delay. By default, the js_handler is executed on worker process 0.
The optional worker_affinity parameter
allows specifying particular worker processes
where the location content handler should be executed.
Each worker process set is represented by a bitmask of allowed worker processes.
The all mask allows the handler to be executed
in all worker processes. Example: example.conf:

location @periodics {
    # to be run at 1 minute intervals in worker process 0
    js_periodic main.handler interval=60s;

    # to be run at 1 minute intervals in all worker processes
    js_periodic main.handler interval=60s worker_affinity=all;

    # to be run at 1 minute intervals in worker processes 1 and 3
    js_periodic main.handler interval=60s worker_affinity=0101;

    resolver 10.0.0.1;
    js_fetch_trusted_certificate /path/to/ISRG_Root_X1.pem;
}

example.js:

async function handler(s) {
    let reply = await ngx.fetch('https://nginx.org/en/docs/njs/');
    let body = await reply.text();

    ngx.log(ngx.INFO, body);
} Syntax: js_preload_object name.json | name from file.json ; Default: — Context: http , server , location This directive appeared in version 0.7.8. Preloads an immutable object at configure time.
The name is used as a name of the global variable
though which the object is available in njs code.
If the name is not specified,
the file name will be used instead. js_preload_object map.json; Here, the map is used as a name
while accessing the preloaded object. Several js_preload_object directives can be specified. Syntax: js_set $variable function | module.function [ nocache ]; Default: — Context: http , server , location Sets an njs function for the specified variable .
Since 0.4.0 ,
a module function can be referenced. The function is called when
the variable is referenced for the first time for a given request.
The exact moment depends on a phase at which the variable is referenced.
This can be used to perform some logic
not related to variable evaluation.
For example, if the variable is referenced only in the log_format directive,
its handler will not be executed until the log phase.
This handler can be used to do some cleanup
right before the request is freed. Since 0.8.6 ,
if an optional argument nocache is specified,
the handler is called every time it is referenced.
Due to current limitations
of the rewrite module,
when a nocache variable is referenced by the set directive
its handler should always return a fixed-length value. As the js_set handler
returns its result immediately, it supports
only synchronous operations.
Thus, asynchronous operations such as r.subrequest() or setTimeout() are not supported. The directive can be specified on the server and location level
since 0.7.7 . Syntax: js_shared_dict_zone zone = name : size [ timeout = time ]
    [ type = string | number ]
    [ evict ]
    [ state = file ]; Default: — Context: http This directive appeared in version 0.8.0. Sets the name and size of the shared memory zone
that keeps the
key-value dictionary shared between worker processes. By default the shared dictionary uses a string as a key and a value.
The optional type parameter
allows redefining the value type to number. The optional timeout parameter sets
the time in milliseconds
after which all shared dictionary entries are removed from the zone.
If some entries require a different removal time, it can be set
with the timeout argument of the add , incr , and set methods
( 0.8.5 ). The optional evict parameter removes the oldest
key-value pair when the zone storage is exhausted. The optional state parameter specifies a file that keeps the shared dictionary state
in JSON format and makes it persistent across nginx restarts
( 0.9.1 ). Example: example.conf:
    # Creates a 1Mb dictionary with string values,
    # removes key-value pairs after 60 seconds of inactivity:
    js_shared_dict_zone zone=foo:1M timeout=60s;

    # Creates a 512Kb dictionary with string values,
    # forcibly removes oldest key-value pairs when the zone is exhausted:
    js_shared_dict_zone zone=bar:512K timeout=30s evict;

    # Creates a 32Kb permanent dictionary with number values:
    js_shared_dict_zone zone=num:32k type=number;

    # Creates a 1Mb dictionary with string values and persistent state:
    js_shared_dict_zone zone=persistent:1M state=/tmp/dict.json;

example.js:
    function get(r) {
        r.return(200, ngx.shared.foo.get(r.args.key));
    }

    function set(r) {
        r.return(200, ngx.shared.foo.set(r.args.key, r.args.value));
    }

    function del(r) {
        r.return(200, ngx.shared.bar.delete(r.args.key));
    }

    function increment(r) {
        r.return(200, ngx.shared.num.incr(r.args.key, 2));
    } Syntax: js_var $variable [ value ]; Default: — Context: http , server , location This directive appeared in version 0.5.3. Declares
a writable variable.
The value can contain text, variables, and their combination.
The variable is not overwritten after a redirect
unlike variables created with the set directive. The directive can be specified on the server and location level
since 0.7.7 . Request Argument Each HTTP njs handler receives one argument, a request object .
