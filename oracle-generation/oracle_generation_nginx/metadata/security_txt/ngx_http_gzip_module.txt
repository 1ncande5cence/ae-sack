Module ngx_http_gzip_module The NGINX Team wants to hear from you. Take the 2025 NGINX User Survey . Module ngx_http_gzip_module Example Configuration Directives gzip gzip_buffers gzip_comp_level gzip_disable gzip_http_version gzip_min_length gzip_proxied gzip_types gzip_vary Embedded Variables The ngx_http_gzip_module module is a filter
that compresses responses using the “gzip” method.
This often helps to reduce the size of transmitted data by half or even more. When using the SSL/TLS protocol, compressed responses may be subject to BREACH attacks. Example Configuration gzip            on;
gzip_min_length 1000;
gzip_proxied    expired no-cache no-store private auth;
gzip_types      text/plain application/xml; The $gzip_ratio variable can be used to log the
achieved compression ratio. Directives Syntax: gzip on | off ; Default: gzip off; Context: http , server , location , if in location Enables or disables gzipping of responses. Syntax: gzip_buffers number size ; Default: gzip_buffers 32 4k|16 8k; Context: http , server , location Sets the number and size of buffers
used to compress a response.
By default, the buffer size is equal to one memory page.
This is either 4K or 8K, depending on a platform. Until version 0.7.28, four 4K or 8K buffers were used by default. Syntax: gzip_comp_level level ; Default: gzip_comp_level 1; Context: http , server , location Sets a gzip compression level of a response.
Acceptable values are in the range from 1 to 9. Syntax: gzip_disable regex ...; Default: — Context: http , server , location This directive appeared in version 0.6.23. Disables gzipping of responses for requests with
“User-Agent” header fields matching
any of the specified regular expressions. The special mask “ msie6 ” (0.7.12) corresponds to
the regular expression “ MSIE [4-6]\. ”, but works faster.
Starting from version 0.8.11, “ MSIE 6.0; ... SV1 ”
is excluded from this mask. Syntax: gzip_http_version 1.0 | 1.1 ; Default: gzip_http_version 1.1; Context: http , server , location Sets the minimum HTTP version of a request required to compress a response. Syntax: gzip_min_length length ; Default: gzip_min_length 20; Context: http , server , location Sets the minimum length of a response that will be gzipped.
The length is determined only from the “Content-Length”
response header field. Syntax: gzip_proxied off | expired | no-cache | no-store | private | no_last_modified | no_etag | auth | any ...; Default: gzip_proxied off; Context: http , server , location Enables or disables gzipping of responses for proxied
requests depending on the request and response.
The fact that the request is proxied is determined by
the presence of the “Via” request header field.
The directive accepts multiple parameters: off disables compression for all proxied requests,
ignoring other parameters; expired enables compression if a response header includes the
“Expires” field with a value that disables caching; no-cache enables compression if a response header includes the
“Cache-Control” field with the
“ no-cache ” parameter; no-store enables compression if a response header includes the
“Cache-Control” field with the
“ no-store ” parameter; private enables compression if a response header includes the
“Cache-Control” field with the
“ private ” parameter; no_last_modified enables compression if a response header does not include the
“Last-Modified” field; no_etag enables compression if a response header does not include the
“ETag” field; auth enables compression if a request header includes the
“Authorization” field; any enables compression for all proxied requests. Syntax: gzip_types mime-type ...; Default: gzip_types text/html; Context: http , server , location Enables gzipping of responses for the specified MIME types in addition
to “ text/html ”.
The special value “ * ” matches any MIME type (0.8.29).
Responses with the “ text/html ” type are always compressed. Syntax: gzip_vary on | off ; Default: gzip_vary off; Context: http , server , location Enables or disables inserting the “Vary: Accept-Encoding”
response header field if the directives gzip , gzip_static , or gunzip are active. Embedded Variables $gzip_ratio achieved compression ratio, computed as the ratio between the
original and compressed response sizes.
