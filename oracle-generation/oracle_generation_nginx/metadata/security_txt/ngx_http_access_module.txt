Module ngx_http_access_module The NGINX Team wants to hear from you. Take the 2025 NGINX User Survey . Module ngx_http_access_module Example Configuration Directives allow deny The ngx_http_access_module module allows
limiting access to certain client addresses. Access can also be limited by password , by the result of subrequest ,
or by JWT .
Simultaneous limitation of access by address and by password is controlled
by the satisfy directive. Example Configuration location / {
    deny  192.168.1.1;
    allow 192.168.1.0/24;
    allow 10.1.1.0/16;
    allow 2001:0db8::/32;
    deny  all;
} The rules are checked in sequence until the first match is found.
In this example, access is allowed only for IPv4 networks 10.1.1.0/16 and 192.168.1.0/24 excluding the address 192.168.1.1 ,
and for IPv6 network 2001:0db8::/32 .
In case of a lot of rules, the use of the ngx_http_geo_module module variables is preferable. Directives Syntax: allow address | CIDR | unix: | all ; Default: — Context: http , server , location , limit_except Allows access for the specified network or address.
If the special value unix: is specified (1.5.1),
allows access for all UNIX-domain sockets. Syntax: deny address | CIDR | unix: | all ; Default: — Context: http , server , location , limit_except Denies access for the specified network or address.
If the special value unix: is specified (1.5.1),
denies access for all UNIX-domain sockets.
