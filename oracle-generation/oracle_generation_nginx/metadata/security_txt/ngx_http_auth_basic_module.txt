Module ngx_http_auth_basic_module The NGINX Team wants to hear from you. Take the 2025 NGINX User Survey . Module ngx_http_auth_basic_module Example Configuration Directives auth_basic auth_basic_user_file The ngx_http_auth_basic_module module allows
limiting access to resources by validating the user name and password
using the “HTTP Basic Authentication” protocol. Access can also be limited by address , by the result of subrequest ,
or by JWT .
Simultaneous limitation of access by address and by password is controlled
by the satisfy directive. Example Configuration location / {
    auth_basic           "closed site";
    auth_basic_user_file conf/htpasswd;
} Directives Syntax: auth_basic string | off ; Default: auth_basic off; Context: http , server , location , limit_except Enables validation of user name and password using the
“HTTP Basic Authentication” protocol.
The specified parameter is used as a realm .
Parameter value can contain variables (1.3.10, 1.2.7).
The special value off cancels the effect
of the auth_basic directive
inherited from the previous configuration level. Syntax: auth_basic_user_file file ; Default: — Context: http , server , location , limit_except Specifies a file that keeps user names and passwords,
in the following format: # comment
name1:password1
name2:password2:comment
name3:password3 The file name can contain variables. The following password types are supported: encrypted with the crypt() function; can be generated using
the “ htpasswd ” utility from the Apache HTTP Server
distribution or the “ openssl passwd ” command; hashed with the Apache variant of the MD5-based password algorithm (apr1);
can be generated with the same tools; specified by the
“ { scheme } data ”
syntax (1.0.3+) as described in RFC 2307 ;
currently implemented schemes include PLAIN (an example one,
should not be used), SHA (1.3.13) (plain SHA-1
hashing, should not be used) and SSHA (salted SHA-1 hashing,
used by some software packages, notably OpenLDAP and Dovecot). Support for SHA scheme was added only to aid
in migration from other web servers.
It should not be used for new passwords, since unsalted SHA-1 hashing
that it employs is vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.
