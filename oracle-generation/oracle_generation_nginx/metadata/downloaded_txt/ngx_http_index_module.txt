Module ngx_http_index_module The NGINX Team wants to hear from you. Take the 2025 NGINX User Survey . Module ngx_http_index_module Example Configuration Directives index The ngx_http_index_module module processes requests
ending with the slash character (‘ / ’).
Such requests can also be processed by the ngx_http_autoindex_module and ngx_http_random_index_module modules. Example Configuration location / {
    index index.$geo.html index.html;
} Directives Syntax: index file ...; Default: index index.html; Context: http , server , location Defines files that will be used as an index.
The file name can contain variables.
Files are checked in the specified order.
The last element of the list can be a file with an absolute path.
Example: index index.$geo.html index.0.html /index.html; It should be noted that using an index file causes an internal redirect,
and the request can be processed in a different location.
For example, with the following configuration: location = / {
    index index.html;
}

location / {
    ...
} a “ / ” request will actually be processed in the
second location as “ /index.html ”.
