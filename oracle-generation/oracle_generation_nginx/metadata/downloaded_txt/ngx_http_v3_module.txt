Module ngx_http_v3_module The NGINX Team wants to hear from you. Take the 2025 NGINX User Survey . Module ngx_http_v3_module Known Issues Example Configuration Directives http3 http3_hq http3_max_concurrent_streams http3_stream_buffer_size quic_active_connection_id_limit quic_bpf quic_gso quic_host_key quic_retry Embedded Variables The ngx_http_v3_module module (1.25.0) provides
experimental support for HTTP/3 . This module is not built by default, it should be enabled with the --with-http_v3_module configuration parameter. An SSL library that provides QUIC support
such as BoringSSL , LibreSSL , or QuicTLS is recommended to build and run this module.
Otherwise,
when using the OpenSSL library,
OpenSSL compatibility layer will be used that does not support early data . Known Issues The module is experimental, caveat emptor applies. Example Configuration http {
    log_format quic '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] '
                    '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                    '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" "$http3"';

    access_log logs/access.log quic;

    server {
        # for better compatibility it's recommended
        # to use the same port for http/3 and https
        listen 8443 quic reuseport;
        listen 8443 ssl;

        ssl_certificate     certs/example.com.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key certs/example.com.key;

        location / {
            # used to advertise the availability of HTTP/3
            add_header Alt-Svc 'h3=":8443"; ma=86400';
        }
    }
} Note that accepting HTTP/3 connections over TLS requires
the TLSv1.3 protocol support, which is available since OpenSSL version 1.1.1. Directives Syntax: http3 on | off ; Default: http3 on; Context: http , server Enables HTTP/3 protocol negotiation. Syntax: http3_hq on | off ; Default: http3_hq off; Context: http , server Enables HTTP/0.9 protocol negotiation
used in QUIC
interoperability tests . Syntax: http3_max_concurrent_streams number ; Default: http3_max_concurrent_streams 128; Context: http , server Sets the maximum number of concurrent HTTP/3 request streams
in a connection. Syntax: http3_stream_buffer_size size ; Default: http3_stream_buffer_size 64k; Context: http , server Sets the size of the buffer used for reading and writing of the
QUIC streams. Syntax: quic_active_connection_id_limit number ; Default: quic_active_connection_id_limit 2; Context: http , server Sets the
QUIC active_connection_id_limit transport parameter value.
This is the maximum number of client connection IDs
which can be stored on the server. Syntax: quic_bpf on | off ; Default: quic_bpf off; Context: main Enables routing of QUIC packets using eBPF .
When enabled, this allows supporting QUIC connection migration. The directive is only supported on Linux 5.7+. Syntax: quic_gso on | off ; Default: quic_gso off; Context: http , server Enables sending in optimized batch mode
using segmentation offloading. Optimized sending is supported only on Linux
featuring UDP_SEGMENT . Syntax: quic_host_key file ; Default: — Context: http , server Sets a file with the secret key used to encrypt
stateless reset and address validation tokens.
By default, a random key is generated on each reload.
Tokens generated with old keys are not accepted. Syntax: quic_retry on | off ; Default: quic_retry off; Context: http , server Enables the QUIC
Address Validation feature.
This includes sending a new token in a Retry packet
or a NEW_TOKEN frame
and
validating a token received in the Initial packet. Embedded Variables The ngx_http_v3_module module
supports the following embedded variables: $http3 negotiated protocol identifier:
“ h3 ” for HTTP/3 connections,
“ hq ” for hq connections,
or an empty string otherwise.
