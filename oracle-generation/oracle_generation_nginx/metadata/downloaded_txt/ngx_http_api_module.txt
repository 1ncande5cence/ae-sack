for accessing various status information,
configuring upstream server groups on-the-fly, and managing key-value pairs without the need of reconfiguring nginx. The module supersedes the ngx_http_status_module and ngx_http_upstream_conf_module modules. When using the PATCH or POST methods,
make sure that the payload does not exceed the buffer size for reading the client request body, otherwise, the
413 (Request Entity Too Large)
error may be returned. This module is available as part of our commercial subscription . Example Configuration http {

http://127.0.0.1/api/9/stream/upstreams/backend/servers/1 Directives Syntax: api [ write = on | off ]; Default: — Context: location Turns on the REST API interface in the surrounding location.
Access to this location should be limited . The write parameter determines whether the API
is read-only or read-write.
By default, the API is read-only. All API requests should contain a supported API version in the URI.
If the request URI equals the location prefix,
the list of supported API versions is returned.
The current API version is “ 9 ”. The optional “ fields ” argument in the request line
specifies which fields of the requested objects will be output: http://127.0.0.1/api/9/nginx?fields=version,build Syntax: status_zone zone ; Default: — Context: server , location , if in location This directive appeared in version 1.13.12. Enables collection of virtual http or stream server status information in the specified zone .
Several servers may share the same zone. Starting from 1.17.0, status information can be collected
per location .
The special value off disables statistics collection
in nested location blocks.
Note that the statistics is collected
in the context of a location where processing ends.
It may be different from the original location, if an internal
redirect happens during request processing. Compatibility The /license data
were added in version 9 (1.27.2). The /workers/ data
were added in version 9. Detailed failure counters were added to SSL statistics
in version 8 (1.23.2). The ssl data
for each HTTP upstream , server zone ,
and stream upstream , server zone ,
were added in version 8 (1.21.6). The codes data
in responses for each HTTP upstream , server zone , and location zone were added in version 7. The /stream/limit_conns/ data
were added in version 6. The /http/limit_conns/ data
were added in version 6. The /http/limit_reqs/ data
were added in version 6. The “ expire ” parameter of a key-value pair can be set or changed since version 5. The /resolvers/ data
were added in version 5. The /http/location_zones/ data
were added in version 5. The path and method fields of nginx error object were removed in version 4.
These fields continue to exist in earlier api versions,
but show an empty value. The /stream/zone_sync/ data
were added in version 3. The drain parameter
was added in version 2. The /stream/keyvals/ data
were added in version 2. Endpoints / Supported methods: GET - Return list of root endpoints Returns a list of root endpoints.
