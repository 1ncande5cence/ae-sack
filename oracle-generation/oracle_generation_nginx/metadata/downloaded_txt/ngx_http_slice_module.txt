Module ngx_http_slice_module The NGINX Team wants to hear from you. Take the 2025 NGINX User Survey . Module ngx_http_slice_module Known Issues Example Configuration Directives slice Embedded Variables The ngx_http_slice_module module (1.9.8) is a filter
that splits a request into subrequests,
each returning a certain range of response.
The filter provides more effective caching of big responses. This module is not built by default, it should be enabled with the --with-http_slice_module configuration parameter. Known Issues Currently, the module does not work as expected in subrequests such as background cache update .
In this case, a request is constructed without byte-range support. Example Configuration location / { slice 1m;
    proxy_cache       cache;
    proxy_cache_key   $uri$is_args$args $slice_range ;
    proxy_set_header  Range $slice_range ;
    proxy_cache_valid 200 206 1h;
    proxy_pass        http://localhost:8000;
} In this example,
the response is split into 1-megabyte cacheable slices. Directives Syntax: slice size ; Default: slice 0; Context: http , server , location Sets the size of the slice.
The zero value disables splitting responses into slices.
Note that a too low value may result in excessive memory usage
and opening a large number of files. In order for a subrequest to return the required range,
the $slice_range variable should be passed to
the proxied server as the Range request header field.
If caching is enabled, $slice_range should be added to the cache key and caching of responses with 206 status code should be enabled . Embedded Variables The ngx_http_slice_module module
supports the following embedded variables: $slice_range the current slice range in HTTP
byte range format,
for example, bytes=0-1048575 .
