Module ngx_http_gunzip_module The NGINX Team wants to hear from you. Take the 2025 NGINX User Survey . Module ngx_http_gunzip_module Example Configuration Directives gunzip gunzip_buffers The ngx_http_gunzip_module module is a filter that
decompresses responses with “ Content-Encoding: gzip ”
for clients that do not support “gzip” encoding method.
The module will be useful when it is desirable to store
data compressed to save space and reduce I/O costs. This module is not built by default, it should be enabled with the --with-http_gunzip_module configuration parameter. Example Configuration location /storage/ {
    gunzip on;
    ...
} Directives Syntax: gunzip on | off ; Default: gunzip off; Context: http , server , location Enables or disables decompression of gzipped responses
for clients that lack gzip support.
If enabled, the following directives are also taken into account
when determining if clients support gzip: gzip_http_version , gzip_proxied , and gzip_disable .
See also the gzip_vary directive. Syntax: gunzip_buffers number size ; Default: gunzip_buffers 32 4k|16 8k; Context: http , server , location Sets the number and size of buffers
used to decompress a response.
By default, the buffer size is equal to one memory page.
This is either 4K or 8K, depending on a platform.
