Module ngx_http_status_module The NGINX Team wants to hear from you. Take the 2025 NGINX User Survey . Module ngx_http_status_module Example Configuration Directives status status_format status_zone Data Compatibility The ngx_http_status_module module provides
access to various status information. This module was available as part of our commercial subscription until 1.13.10.
It was superseded by the ngx_http_api_module module
in 1.13.3. Example Configuration http {

http://127.0.0.1/status/stream/upstreams/backend/peers/1/weight The simple monitoring page is shipped with this distribution,
accessible as “ /status.html ” in the default configuration.
It requires the locations “ /status ” and
“ /status.html ” to be configured as shown above. Directives Syntax: status ; Default: — Context: location The status information will be accessible from the surrounding location.
Access to this location should be limited . Syntax: status_format json ; status_format jsonp [ callback ]; Default: status_format json; Context: http , server , location By default, status information is output in the JSON format. Alternatively, data may be output as JSONP.
The callback parameter specifies the name of a callback function.
Parameter value can contain variables.
If parameter is omitted, or the computed value is an empty string,
then “ ngx_status_jsonp_callback ” is used. Syntax: status_zone zone ; Default: — Context: server Enables collection of virtual http or stream (1.7.11) server status information in the specified zone .
