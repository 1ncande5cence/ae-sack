After reviewing the provided documents and my background knowledge on V8 and d8, I find that the documents do not explicitly describe a configurable security feature named "Restricted Native Module Loading" or a direct mechanism in d8 to control or restrict native module or dynamic library loading. The documents focus on V8’s embedding, profiling, debugging, design reviews, and other internal mechanisms, but do not mention native module loading restrictions or related configuration.

Given this, it is not possible to generate a detailed security oracle for "Restricted Native Module Loading" in d8 based on the provided materials.

### Explanation

- The documents describe d8 as a developer shell for V8, useful for running JavaScript and debugging, but do not mention any support for loading native modules or dynamic libraries.
- There is no mention of configuration flags, compilation options, or runtime commands in d8 that enable or restrict native module loading.
- The security feature as described ("D8 does not support loading arbitrary native modules or dynamic libraries") is more of a design limitation or default behavior rather than a configurable security feature.
- Without explicit configuration steps, testable inputs, or observable outputs related to native module loading, a security oracle cannot be constructed.

If you have additional documentation or details about a specific mechanism or flag related to native module loading in d8 or V8, please provide them, and I can reassess.
