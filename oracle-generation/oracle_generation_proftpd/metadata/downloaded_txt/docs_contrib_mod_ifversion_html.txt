ProFTPD module mod_ifversion ProFTPD module mod_ifversion The mod_ifversion module is designed for use in testsuites and
production deployments of proftpd , which may have to deal with
different ProFTPD versions and different configurations.  The <IfVersion> sections supported by mod_ifversion allow flexible version checking, including numeric and regular expression
comparisons. This module is contained in the mod_ifversion.c file for
ProFTPD 1.3. x , and is not compiled by default.  Installation
instructions are discussed here ; a discussion
on usage is also available. The most current version of mod_ifversion is distributed with
the proftpd source code. Author Please contact TJ Saunders <tj at castaglia.org> with any
questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding this module. Directives <IfVersion> <IfVersion> Syntax: <IfVersion [[!]operator] version > Default: None Context: All Module: mod_ifversion Compatibility: 1.3.1rc1 and later The <IfVersion> section encloses configuration directives
which will be used only if the proftpd version matches the configured criteria.
For normal (numeric) comparisons the version argument has the following
syntax: major[.minor[.revision[suffix]]] e.g. 1.3.1, 1.3.2a, or 1.3.3rc1. If the minor or revision fields are omitted, they are assumed to be zero.  An
omitted suffix is assumed to be a stable release, instead of a release
candidate (RC) or maintenance release. The following numerical comparison operators are supported: operator Description = or == proftpd version is equal > proftpd version is greater than >= proftpd version is greater or equal < proftpd version is less than <= proftpd version is less or equal It is also possible to use regular expressions to match the ProFTPD version.
To use a regular expression, the operators are: operator Description = or == version has the form / regex / ~ version has the form regex If you wish to reverse the meaning of the operator, prefix the operator with an exclamation mark (!), e.g. : <IfVersion != 1.3.1>
    # Do not use these directives if the version is 1.3.1
  </IfVersion> If operator is omitted, it is assumed to be = . Installation The mod_ifversion module is distributed with ProFTPD.  For
including mod_ifversion as a statically linked module: $ ./configure --with-modules=mod_ifversion To build mod_ifversion as a DSO module: $ ./configure --enable-dso --with-shared=mod_ifversion Then follow the usual steps: $ make
  $ make install For those with an existing ProFTPD installation, you can use the prxs tool to add mod_ifversion , as a DSO module, to
your existing server: $ prxs -c -i -d mod_ifversion.c Usage The following examples demonstrate how the mod_ifversion can
be used. Using a simple numeric comparison: <IfVersion >= 1.3.1rc1>
    # Only use these directives for versions greater or equal 1.3.1rc1
  </IfVersion> Using a regular expression: <IfVersion = /^rc[[:digit:]]$/>
    # Only use these directives for RC (release candidate) versions
  </IfVersion> Using a reversed regular expression ( i.e. in this case, meaning
"proftpd version does not match this pattern"): <IfVersion !~ ^1.3.[012]$>
    # These directives are not for those versions
