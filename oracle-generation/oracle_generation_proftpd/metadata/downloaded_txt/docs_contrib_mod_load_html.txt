ProFTPD module mod_load ProFTPD module mod_load This module is contained in the mod_load.h and mod_load.c files for ProFTPD 1.2. x , and is not compiled by
default.  Installation instructions are discussed here .  There are also some interesting notes
on the usage of this module. The code for determining load average on a given system is hairy, to say the
least.  Unfortunately, it is necessary to do it this way, as there is no
standard method for extracting such information from the kernel.  This module
uses code from GNU's make application, which should function
properly.  If not, please contact the author as soon as possible. The most current version of mod_load is distributed with the
ProFTPD source code. Author Please contact TJ Saunders <tj at castaglia.org> with any
questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding this module. Directives MaxLoad MaxLoad Syntax: MaxLoad number|"none" [message] Default: None Context: server config, <VirtualHost> , <Global> Module: mod_load Compatibility: 1.2.2 and later The MaxLoad directive configures the server to refuse to accept
connections if the system load is at or above the configured number.  An
optional message can be specified, which will be displayed to clients who have
been rejected.  The rejection is also logged. The number can also be "none", which is used to override any
inherited load limits, as from a <Global> context. The system load is the average number of processes ready to run during the
last minute; this number varies from system to system. Example: # Reject connections to our busy server
  MaxLoad 10.0 "Server busy, seek elsewhere" Usage The mod_load module is very straightforward, providing only
the single configuration directive. Display Variables The following variables are provided by mod_load , and
can be used in any Display file e.g. DisplayConnect and DisplayLogin . %{mod_load.curr_load}
  %{mod_load.max_load} Installation To install mod_load , follow the usual steps for using third-party
modules in ProFTPD: $ ./configure --with-modules=mod_load
