ProFTPD: Upgrading ProFTPD: Upgrading Upgrading proftpd is usually a straightforward process, but
as with any upgrade, double-checking that the upgrade will not break anything
is a Good Idea. Recent ProFTPD releases have a RELEASE_NOTES file in the
source distribution that documents the changes in that release, including
new configuration directives, new contrib modules, deprecated directives,
special instructions, etc .  In addition, the NEWS file
contains a list of the bugs that have fixed, and comments about any changes
the bugfix required. Please read these files carefully before
starting your upgrade. One safe way to test the upgrade is to compile the new proftpd ,
and test it out on your existing configuration file before actually installing
the new version into the "live" location: $ tar zxvf proftpd- version .tar.gz
  $ cd proftpd- version /
  $ ./configure ..
  $ make
  $ ./proftpd -t -d10 -c /path/to/proftpd.conf The " ./proftpd " means to use the new proftpd binary compiled by make , but not yet
installed.  If the new binary reports errors, make a copy of your existing proftpd.conf file, keeping the old one as a backup: $ cp /path/to/proftpd.conf /path/to/proftpd.conf.new Make any needed changes to the proftpd.conf.new file, until
the new proftpd binary reports a successful syntax check: $ ./proftpd -t -d10 -c /path/to/proftpd.conf.new Once everything is configured the way you like, install the new binary and
configuration file: $ make install
  $ cp /path/to/proftpd.conf /path/to/proftpd.conf.old
  $ mv /path/to/proftpd.conf.new /path/to/proftpd.conf Now do a stop/start on proftpd , and the new version of ProFTPD
will be running. © Copyright 2017 The ProFTPD Project All Rights Reserved
