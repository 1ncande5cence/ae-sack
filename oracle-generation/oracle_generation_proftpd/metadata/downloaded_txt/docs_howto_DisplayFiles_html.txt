ProFTPD: Display Files ProFTPD: Display Files ProFTPD supports a number of configuration directives that specify a file
whose contents should be displayed to connected clients at various times: DisplayConnect Displayed to clients as soon as they connect DisplayLogin Displayed to clients once they have logged in using the USER and PASS commands DisplayChdir Displayed to a client whenever it changes into a directory DisplayFileTransfer Displayed to the client whenever a file is successfully transfer,
        either uploaded or downloaded DisplayQuit Displayed to a client when the session ends via the QUIT command Note the subtle difference between DisplayConnect and DisplayLogin .  A DisplayConnect file will be
displayed to all clients; this makes it suitable for server banners,
messages of the day, etc .  A DisplayLogin file will only
be displayed once the client has logged in. The configured file paths can be either relative or absolute (except in the
case of DisplayConnect , which always requires absolute paths).
In the case of a relative path, the file is assumed to be in the starting
directory a user, i.e. the <Anonymous> directory
for anonymous logins, and the user's home directory for non-anonymous logins. Note : If DefaultRoot is in effect, then the file must reside inside the chroot ed directory. If the 
configured file cannot be found or accessed, no error occurs and nothing is
logged or displayed to the client. Display Variables The following table contains the variables that can be used in Display files. Be aware that not all of these may have a rational
value, depending on the context in which they are used ( e.g. , %u if IdentLookups are off ). Other contrib modules may provide additional variables for use
as well; please consult their documentation for more information. Variable Meaning %C Current working directory %E Server admin's email address %F Available space on file system, in KB %f Available space on file system, with units %i The number of files uploaded (input) in this session %K Total number of bytes transferred %k Total number of bytes transferred, in units %L Local hostname %M Maximum number of connections %N Current number of connections %o The number of files downloaded (output) in this session %R Remote hostname %T Current time %t The number of files transferred (uploaded and downloaded) in this session %U Username originally used to login %u Username reported by ident protocol %V ServerName of virtual host, if any %x The name of the user's Class , if any %y Current number of connections from the user's Class %z Maximum number of connections from the user's Class %{total_bytes_in} The number of bytes uploaded (input) in this session %{total_bytes_out} The number of bytes downloaded (output) in this session %{total_bytes_xfer} The number of bytes transferred (uploaded and downloaded) in this session %{total_files_in} The number of files uploaded (input) in this session %{total_files_out} The number of files downloaded (output) in this session %{total_files_xfer} The number of files transferred (uploaded and downloaded) in this session %{env: name } The value of the environment variable name %{time: format } Uses format (as per the strftime(3) function) to format a timestamp Frequently Asked Questions Question : I configured a path which contains spaces for DisplayLogin , and it doesn't work.  Why not? Answer : If using paths/files which contains spaces,
make sure that you enclose the path in quotation marks, e.g. : DisplayLogin "/path/to/display login.txt" Otherwise, the configuration file parser will treat the space-separated
portions of the path as separate directive parameters. Question : I configured a DisplayLogin file which uses the %F variable, but it is not showing me the
correct amount of bytes available on my system.  Why not? Answer :  ProFTPD determines the available bytes for
the %F / %f variables based on the filesystem
containing the Display file . For example, if your Display file is in /etc/proftpd ,,
and the /etc directory is mounted on a small disk, then %F / %f will only report on the bytes available in the /etc filesystem, not on other filesystems ( e.g. not
the /home filesystem). © Copyright 2012-2017 The ProFTPD Project All Rights Reserved
