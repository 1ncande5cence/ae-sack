ProFTPD: .ftpaccess Files ProFTPD: .ftpaccess Files A .ftpaccess file is meant to function like Apache's .htaccess file: a file that acts as free-floating section of the
server's configuration file.  If a .ftpaccess file is present in
a directory in which ProFTPD performs some action, ProFTPD will parse that .ftpaccess file as a configuration file, and act accordingly.
Note that only some configuration directives are allowed in the .ftpaccess section, though. The advantage of having this capability is that users can customize how the
server treats directories that are under the user's control, by using files
placed in those directories, instead of allowing the user to modify the main
server configuration file itself.  The disadvantage is that a user is
capable of possibly overriding a configuration value that was set in the main
configuration file for a specific purpose. ProFTPD treats a directory that contains a .ftpaccess file
exactly as if the configuration directives in that file had been placed in
a <Directory> section in the main proftpd.conf file.  For example, if there is a /home/users/bob directory on
your system, and in that directory there was a .ftpaccess file
that contained: DirFakeUser on ~
  DirFakeGroup on ~
  Umask 0077 it would be treated exactly as if: <Directory /home/users/bob>
    DirFakeUser on ~
    DirFakeGroup on ~
    Umask 0077
  </Directory> was written into proftpd.conf . The AllowOverride directive can be used to disable ProFTPD's support for .ftpaccess files. © Copyright 2017 The ProFTPD Project All Rights Reserved
