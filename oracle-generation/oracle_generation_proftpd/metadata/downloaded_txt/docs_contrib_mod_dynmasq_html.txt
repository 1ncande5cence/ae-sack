ProFTPD module mod_dynmasq ProFTPD module mod_dynmasq The mod_dynmasq module is designed for those sites that
use the MasqueradeAddress directive in conjunction with DNS
names whose addresses periodically change, e.g. "dyndns"
addresses.  The proftpd daemon is not aware of any changes
to the IP address for a MasqueradeAddress that happen after
the daemon has started up.  The mod_dynmasq module periodically
checks all configured MasqueradeAddress directives and resolves
their IP addresses, updating the stored addresses as needed. This module is contained in the mod_dynmasq.c file for
ProFTPD 1.2.10 and later, and is not compiled by default.  Installation
instructions are discussed here . The most current version of mod_dynmasq is distributed with
the proftpd source distribution. Author Please contact TJ Saunders <tj at castaglia.org> with any
questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding this module. Directives DynMasqRefresh DynMasqRefresh Syntax: DynMasqRefresh secs Default: None Context: server config Module: mod_dynmasq Compatibility: 1.2.10 The DynMasqRefresh directive configures the amount of time,
in seconds, between mod_dynmasq 's checking and updating of
all MasqueradeAddress directives.  If no DynMasqRefresh directive is configured, then the module will
do no checking. The process of resolving a DNS name to its IP address can, depending on
the DNS configuration, take a noticeable amount of time.  This, combined
with the number of MasqueradeAddress directives in your proftpd.conf , can cause mod_dynmasq to make
the daemon unavailable while it resolves all addresses.  Therefore it
is highly recommended that the configured interval be as long as possible,
for example for 8 hours. Example: <IfModule mod_dynmasq.c>
    # Refresh any configured MasqueradeAddress directives every 8 hours
    DynMasqRefresh 28800
  </IfModule> See also: Installation The mod_dynmasq module is distributed with ProFTPD.  Follow the
usual steps for using third-party modules in ProFTPD: $ ./configure --with-modules=mod_dynmasq To build mod_dynmasq as a DSO module: $ ./configure --enable-dso --with-shared=mod_dynmasq Then follow the usual steps: $ make
  $ make install For those with an existing ProFTPD installation, you can use the prxs tool to add mod_dynmasq , as a DSO module, to
your existing server: $ prxs -c -i -d mod_dynmasq.c © Copyright 2004-2013 TJ Saunders All Rights Reserved
