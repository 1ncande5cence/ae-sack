ProFTPD module mod_snmp ProFTPD module mod_snmp The mod_snmp module implements SNMPv1 and SNMPv2, for monitoring
of proftpd statistics via SNMP. The mod_snmp module does not currently support: SNMPv3 AgentX SNMP Set requests The mod_snmp module is contained in the mod_snmp/ directory, is intended for ProFTPD 1.3.4rc3 and later, and is not compiled by
default.  Installation instructions are discussed here . The most current version of mod_sftp is distributed with the
ProFTPD source code. Author Please contact TJ Saunders <tj at castaglia.org> with any
questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding this module. Thanks 2013-01-09 : Thanks to <cliles at capario.com> for testing
out most of the mod_snmp features, requesting additional useful
functionality, and providing OpenNMS support/examples. Directives SNMPAgent SNMPCommunity SNMPEngine SNMPLog SNMPMaxVariables SNMPNotify SNMPOptions SNMPTables SNMPAgent Syntax: SNMPAgent master|agentx address[:port] ... Default: None Context: server config Module: mod_snmp Compatibility: 1.3.4rc3 and later The SNMPAgent directive configures the mod_snmp module to act as a "master" SNMP agent/entity, or as an AgentX sub-agent.
( Note that the AgentX capability is not currently implemented.) The address parameter can be an IP address or a DNS name; this
parameter configures the address/port on which mod_snmp will listen
for UDP SNMP packets.  By default, a port of 161 is assumed, use address:port to specify an alternate port, e.g. : SNMPAgent master localhost:1161 Note that IPv6 addresses should be enclosed in square brackets, as they can
contain colons as well, e.g. : SNMPAgent master [::1]:1161 Multiple addresses can be supplied, allowing mod_snmp to listen
on multiple addresses/ports simultaneously: SNMPAgent master 1.2.3.4:1161 [a::f]:2262 Note that the SNMPAgent directive is required . SNMPCommunity Syntax: SNMPCommunity community Default: None Context: server config Module: mod_snmp Compatibility: 1.3.4rc3 and later The SNMPCommunity directive configures the community string (effectively a passphrase) used for authenticating SNMPv1 and SNMPv2
messages. Note that the SNMPCommunity directive is required . SNMPEngine Syntax: SNMPEngine on|off Default: off Context: server config Module: mod_snmp Compatibility: 1.3.4rc3 and later The SNMPEngine directive controls whether the mod_snmp will run as an SNMP agent, and handle SNMP messages. SNMPLog Syntax: SNMPLog file|"none" Default: None Context: server config Module: mod_snmp Compatibility: 1.3.4rc3 and later The SNMPLog directive is used to specify a log file for mod_snmp 's reporting.  The file parameter given must be
the full path to the file to use for logging. Note that this path must not be to a world-writable directory and,
unless AllowLogSymlinks is explicitly set to on (generally a bad idea), the path must not be a symbolic link. SNMPNotify Syntax: SNMPNotify address[:port] Default: None Context: server config, <VirtualHost> , <Global> Module: mod_snmp Compatibility: 1.3.4rc3 and later The SNMPNotify directive is used to specify the address of any SNMP manager that should receive any notification ( i.e. SNMPv2 trap) that mod_snmp can generated.  Read here for more details on the types of notifications that mod_snmp supports. The address parameter can be an IP address or DNS name.  By default,
a port number of 162 is assumed.  To specify the port number, use: SNMPNotify address : port Multiple SNMPNotify directives can be configured; mod_snmp will send notifications to all of them. SNMPOptions Syntax: SNMPOptions opt1 ... Default: None Context: server config Module: mod_snmp Compatibility: 1.3.4rc3 and later The SNMPOptions directive is used to configure various optional
behaviors of mod_snmp . Example: SNMPOptions RestartClearsCounters The currently implemented options are: RestartClearsCounters This option will cause mod_snmp to clear/reset every
    counter ( except for the daemon.restartCount counter)
    whenever proftpd is restarted via the SIGHUP signal. SNMPTables Syntax: SNMPTables path Default: None Context: server config Module: mod_snmp Compatibility: 1.3.4rc3 and later The SNMPTables directive is used to specify a directory that mod_snmp will use for storing its database files; these files
are used for tracking the various statistics reported via SNMP. Installation The mod_snmp module is distributed with ProFTPD.  For including mod_snmp as a statically linked module, use: $ ./configure --with-modules=mod_snmp ... Alternatively, mod_snmp can be built as a DSO module: $ ./configure --enable-dso --with-shared=mod_snmp ... Then follow the usual steps: $ make
  $ make install Usage Important Security Considerations Do not configure mod_snmp to listen on a public Internet
address.  The information provided via mod_snmp can be used
by attackers to gain more information about your running proftpd ,
including being able to determine whether their logins fail due to a wrong
password (in which case, they know that that user name is valid) or not.  It
is highly recommended that you configure mod_snmp to only
listen on internal/LAN addresses.  Furthermore, you should employ a firewall
rule that rejects any UDP packets from the public Internet to your proftpd instance. SNMP Listening Process When proftpd starts up with mod_snmp enabled, the mod_snmp module will fork a new process that acts as the SNMP
agent, receiving and responding to all SNMP requests.  This SNMP listening
process automatically switches to the privileges configured by the User and Group directives, and will also automatically chroot itself to a subdirectory of the SNMPTables directory,
after which all root privileges are permanently dropped. Example Configuration The mod_snmp module uses a UDP socket for listening for SNMP
requests.  Thus it does not require any separate <VirtualHost> sections, and does not interfere with the
normal FTP operations. Here is an example configuration for mod_snmp : <IfModule mod_snmp.c>
    SNMPEngine on
    SNMPLog /etc/proftpd/snmp/snmp.log

    # Configure the agent to listen on 1.2.3.4, port 161
    SNMPAgent master 1.2.3.4 161

    # Configure the SNMP community string
    SNMPCommunity MySnmpCommunity

    # Configure the directory that mod_snmp will use for its database files
    SNMPTables /var/proftpd/snmp
  </IfModule> Access Controls for SNMP Messages Since the SNMPv1/SNMPv2 does not have authentication of "users" as such,
the normal user/group-based ACLs that can be configured in proftpd have no effect on SNMP messages. In order to provide IP-based access control, then, the mod_snmp module supports a <Limit SNMP> section, like the following: Example: <Limit SNMP>
    # Allow SNMP packets from 10.x.x.x and 127.0.0.1 addresses
    Allow from 10., 127.0.0.1
    DenyAll
  </Limit> It is easy to spoof the source address for UDP packets, however.  So it is
far better (and more secure) to use a firewall to restrict which UDP packets
can reach the mod_snmp address/port. Logging The mod_snmp module supports different forms of logging.  The
main module logging is done via the SNMPLog directive.  For
debugging purposes, the module also uses trace logging , via the module-specific log channels: snmp snmp.asn1 snmp.db snmp.mib snmp.msg snmp.notify snmp.pdu snmp.smi Thus for trace logging, to aid in debugging, you would use the following in
your proftpd.conf : TraceLog /path/to/snmp-trace.log
  Trace snmp:20 This trace logging can generate large files; it is intended for debugging
use only, and should be removed from any production configuration. mod_snmp OIDs Note that all mod_snmp OIDs begin with

default.
It is contained in the "PROFTPD-MIB.txt" file, and uses SMIv2. Suggested Future Features The following lists the features I hope to add to mod_snmp ,
according to need, demand, inclination, and time: AgentX support SNMPv3 support Controls support ( e.g. for "ftpdctl snmp" action) Notifications The mod_snmp module supports sending notifications (via SNMP traps ) whenever certain events occur or conditions are met.  Note
that only SNMPv2 traps are generated; there is currently no support for
SNMPv1 traps. Currently supported notifications: MaxInstances limit exceeded Failed FTP login due to bad/wrong password Failed FTP login due to bad/unknown user name To enable notifications, simply configure the address of an SNMP manager
that should be notified via the SNMPNotify directive. Frequently Asked Questions Question : How can I query the mod_snmp Agent process? Answer : You can test if your proftpd supports SNMP with the snmpwalk program ( snmpwalk is
a part of the Net-SNMP project).
Note that you have to specify the SNMP port, which in mod_snmp is
configured via the SNMPAgent directive. For example, you might try: # snmpwalk -m /path/to/PROFTPD-MIB.txt -v2c -Cc -c communitystring hostname:161 .1.3.6.1.4.1.17852.2.2 If it gives output like: enterprises.proftpd.modules.snmp.daemon.software = proftpd
  enterprises.proftpd.modules.snmp.daemon.softwareVersion = ProFTPD Version 1.3.4rc4 (built at Sat Oct 22 2011 11:50:38 PDT)
  enterprises.proftpd.modules.snmp.daemon.admin = root@127.0.0.1 or PROFTPD-MIB::software.0 = String: proftpd
  PROFTPD-MIB::softwareVersion.0 = STRING: ProFTPD Version 1.3.4rc4 (built at Sat Oct 22 2011 11:50:38 PDT)
  PROFTPD-MIB::admin.0 = STRING: root@127.0.0.1 or SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.17852.2.2.1.1.0 = STRING: "proftpd"
  SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.17852.2.2.1.2.0 = STRING: "ProFTPD Version 1.3.4rc4 (built at Sat Oct 22 2011 11:50:38 PDT)"
  SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.17852.2.2.1.3.0 = STRING: "root@127.0.0.1" then your proftpd was compiled with the mod_snmp module and it is working properly; you should be able to make nice statistics
out of it. Question : Why doesn't the scp.scpDataTransfers arc have any directory listing
counters/gauges, such as the ftp.dataTransfers and sftp.sftpDataTransfers arcs do? Answer : The SCP protocol does not have the ability
to get just a directory listing; the protocol only transfers files. © Copyright 2011-2017 TJ Saunders All Rights Reserved
