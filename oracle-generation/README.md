This folder contains the code and original experimental data for oracle generation.

To reproduce the results, please navigate to the corresponding target program folder (e.g., oracle_generation_{target_program}) and follow the instructions in the README.md file within that folder.

If you’d like to test the pipeline on a new program, simply copy the oracle_generation_template folder and use the duplicated version as your working directory.
