Let's evaluate whether a security oracle can be generated for this feature based on the provided documentation and general knowledge.

**Assessment:**  
Yes, a security oracle can be generated. The documentation for Wireshark and its related tools (notably `editcap` and the use of key files) describes how users can provide decryption keys (e.g., for TLS) via key files, and that Wireshark does not store or transmit these keys beyond their use for decryption in the local session. This is a security-relevant behavior: it ensures that sensitive credentials (decryption keys) are not leaked or persisted by Wireshark.

## 1. Security Feature:  
**Support for Decrypting Encrypted Protocols with User Keys (No Key Storage/Transmission)**

Wireshark allows users to provide decryption keys (such as TLS key log files or Kerberos keytabs) to decrypt encrypted network traffic for analysis. Importantly, Wireshark does not store these keys in capture files, nor does it transmit them over the network, thereby protecting sensitive credentials from unintended disclosure.

## 2. Configuration Setup

### 2.1 Compilation Steps

Wireshark and its tools are typically pre-built with support for decryption features. No special compilation is required for this feature on standard distributions.

### 2.2 Configuration File

**Purpose:**  
Configure Wireshark to use a user-supplied decryption key (e.g., a TLS key log file) for decrypting encrypted traffic.

**Example (TLS):**  
- Create a TLS key log file (e.g., `tlskeys.log`) containing secrets in the [NSS Key Log Format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/Key_Log_Format).
- In Wireshark, go to:  
  `Edit` → `Preferences` → `Protocols` → `TLS`  
  Set the "Pre-Master-Secret log filename" to the path of your `tlskeys.log` file.

**Configuration snippet (if using command-line):**
```sh
wireshark -o "tls.keylog_file:/path/to/tlskeys.log" -r encrypted_capture.pcapng
```

### 2.3 Additional Setup Commands and Extra File

**Purpose:**  
Create a TLS key log file for use in decryption.

**Command to create a sample key log file:**
```sh
echo "CLIENT_RANDOM 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef" > tlskeys.log
```
*(In practice, this file is generated by browsers or applications during TLS sessions.)*

## 3. Testing Instructions

### 3.1 Input that Satisfies the Feature (Allowed Behavior)

**Test:**  
- Open a capture file (`encrypted_capture.pcapng`) containing TLS-encrypted traffic.
- Provide the correct TLS key log file (`tlskeys.log`) as described above.
- **Expected Outcome:**  
  - Wireshark successfully decrypts the TLS traffic and displays the plaintext in the packet details.
  - The decrypted data is visible in the GUI or via command-line output.
  - **Verification:**  
    - No copy of the key file is saved in the capture file.
    - The key file is not transmitted over the network (can be verified by monitoring system/network activity).

### 3.2 Input that Violates the Feature (Should Be Blocked/Not Occur)

**Test:**  
- Open the same capture file without providing the key log file, or provide an incorrect key file.
- **Expected Outcome:**  
  - Wireshark does not decrypt the TLS traffic; the payload remains encrypted.
  - No plaintext is visible in the packet details.
  - **Verification:**  
    - The capture file does not contain any decryption keys.
    - No evidence of key file content being stored or transmitted by Wireshark.

### 3.3 Determining Feature Functionality

- If, after providing the key file, decryption occurs and plaintext is visible, but the key file is not stored in the capture file or transmitted, the feature is functioning as expected.
- If, without the key file, decryption does not occur and no plaintext is visible, the feature is also functioning as expected.
- If the key file is found to be stored in the capture file or transmitted over the network, this would be a violation of the security feature.

**Summary:**  
This oracle demonstrates that Wireshark enforces the security property of not storing or transmitting user-supplied decryption keys, while allowing decryption of encrypted protocols for analysis when the user provides the necessary keys at runtime. This can be tested by observing both the presence/absence of decrypted data and the handling of key files.
