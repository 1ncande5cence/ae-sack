Let's evaluate whether a security oracle can be generated for the "No Password Option" in sudo.

**Assessment:**  
Yes, a security oracle can be generated. The documentation provides clear details on how to configure the NOPASSWD tag in the sudoers file, how it is enforced, and how to test its behavior. The feature is well-documented, with concrete configuration syntax, observable effects, and testable outcomes.

# Security Oracle: Sudo "No Password Option" (NOPASSWD)

## 1. Security Feature

**No Password Option (NOPASSWD):**  
This feature allows sudo to be configured so that specific users, groups, or commands can be executed without requiring the user to enter their password. This is controlled via the `NOPASSWD` tag in the sudoers policy file. It is commonly used to enable secure automation (e.g., scripts, scheduled tasks) while minimizing unnecessary password prompts and exposure.

## 2. Configuration Setup

### 2.1 Compilation Steps

*No special compilation steps are required for this feature. Sudo's NOPASSWD functionality is available in all standard builds.*

### 2.2 Configuration File

**Purpose:**  
Configure the sudoers file to allow a specific user (e.g., `alice`) to run a specific command (e.g., `/usr/bin/uptime`) without being prompted for a password, while requiring a password for other commands.

**Steps:**

1. **Edit the sudoers file using visudo (recommended for syntax checking and safety):**
   ```sh
   sudo visudo
   ```

2. **Add the following line to the sudoers file:**
   ```
   alice ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/uptime, PASSWD: /usr/bin/id
   ```
   - This allows user `alice` to run `/usr/bin/uptime` on any host without a password, but requires a password for `/usr/bin/id`.

   *Alternatively, to allow all commands without a password:*
   ```
   alice ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

   *Or, to allow a group (e.g., `sysadmins`) to run all commands without a password:*
   ```
   %sysadmins ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

### 2.3 Additional Setup Commands and Extra File

*No additional files or setup commands are required for this feature.*

## 3. Testing Instructions

### 3.1 Input that Satisfies the Feature (Allowed Behavior)

**Test:**  
Run the allowed command as the configured user (`alice`):

```sh
sudo -u alice sudo /usr/bin/uptime
```
or, if you are already logged in as `alice`:
```sh
sudo /usr/bin/uptime
```

**Expected Observable Outcome:**  
- The command executes immediately, **without prompting for a password**.
- Output example:
  ```
  14:32:01 up 10 days,  2:13,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
  ```

### 3.2 Input that Violates the Feature (Should Be Blocked or Prompted)

**Test:**  
Run a command that is not covered by the NOPASSWD tag (e.g., `/usr/bin/id`):

```sh
sudo /usr/bin/id
```

**Expected Observable Outcome:**  
- **Password prompt appears**:
  ```
  [sudo] password for alice:
  ```
- The command only executes after the correct password is entered.

### 3.3 Determining Enforcement

- If the allowed command (`/usr/bin/uptime`) runs without a password prompt, and the disallowed command (`/usr/bin/id`) prompts for a password, the feature is functioning as expected.
- If both commands run without a password, or both require a password, the configuration is not enforced correctly.

**Summary Table:**

| Command                | Expected Behavior         | Observable Outcome                |
|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| sudo /usr/bin/uptime   | No password prompt       | Command runs immediately          |
| sudo /usr/bin/id       | Password prompt required | Prompt appears before execution   |
