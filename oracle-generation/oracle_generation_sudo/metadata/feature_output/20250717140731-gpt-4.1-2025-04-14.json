        "feature": "User Authentication",
        "explain": "Sudo requires users to authenticate themselves, typically by entering their own password, before executing commands with elevated privileges. This ensures that only authorized users can gain root or other specified privileges."
    },
    {
        "feature": "Access Control via Sudoers File",
        "explain": "Sudo uses the /etc/sudoers file to define which users or groups can run which commands as which users on which hosts. This fine-grained access control restricts the scope of privilege escalation."
    },
    {
        "feature": "Command Execution Control",
        "explain": "Sudo can restrict which commands a user is allowed to execute with elevated privileges, preventing users from running arbitrary or dangerous commands as root."

        "feature": "Logging and Auditing",
        "explain": "Sudo logs all commands executed through it, including the user, command, and timestamp. This provides an audit trail for security monitoring and forensic analysis."

    {
        "feature": "Timestamp Timeout",
        "explain": "After successful authentication, Sudo caches the user's credentials for a configurable timeout period. This limits the window in which a user can run additional sudo commands without re-authenticating, reducing the risk of unauthorized use."

    {
        "feature": "Environment Variable Control",
        "explain": "Sudo sanitizes and controls which environment variables are preserved or reset when running commands, preventing privilege escalation or attacks via malicious environment variables."

    {
        "feature": "Input Validation and Command Whitelisting",
        "explain": "Sudo validates user input and can be configured to only allow specific commands or command arguments, reducing the risk of command injection or misuse."

    {
        "feature": "Privilege Separation",
        "explain": "Sudo uses privilege separation techniques, running most of its code as a non-privileged user and only elevating privileges when necessary, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities."
    },
    {
        "feature": "SELinux/AppArmor Integration",
        "explain": "Sudo can integrate with SELinux or AppArmor, leveraging mandatory access control policies to further restrict what commands or resources can be accessed during sudo sessions."

        "feature": "Password Retry Limit and Lockout",
        "explain": "Sudo can be configured to limit the number of password attempts, locking out users after repeated failures to prevent brute-force attacks."
