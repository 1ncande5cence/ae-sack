Security Advisories | Sudo An attacker can leverage sudo’s -R ( --chroot ) option to run
arbitrary commands as root, even if they are not listed in the
sudoers file. Sudo versions affected: Sudo versions 1.9.14 to 1.9.17 inclusive are affected. CVE ID: This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2025-32463 in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database. ... â¦ Sudo’s host ( -h or --host ) option is intended to be used in
conjunction with the list option ( -l or --list ) to list a user’s
sudo privileges on a host other than the current one.  However, due
to a bug it was not restricted to listing privileges and could be
used when running a command via sudo or editing a file with sudoedit .  Depending on the rules present in the sudoers file
this could allow a local privilege escalation attack. ... â¦ A flaw exists in sudo’s per-command chroot feature that could result
in the variable that stores the command being freed more than once. Sudo versions affected: Sudo versions 1.9.8 through 1.9.13p1 inclusive are affected.
Versions of sudo prior to 1.9.8 are not affected. CVE ID: This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2023-27320 in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database. ... â¦ A flaw in exists in sudo’s -e option (aka sudoedit) that allows a
malicious user with sudoedit privileges to edit arbitrary files. Sudo versions affected: Sudo versions 1.8.0 through 1.9.12p1 inclusive are affected.
Versions of sudo prior to 1.8.0 construct the argument vector
differently and are not affected. CVE ID: This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2023-22809 in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database. ... â¦ A serious heap-based buffer overflow has been discovered in sudo
that is exploitable by any local user. It has been given the name Baron Samedit by its discoverer. The bug can be leveraged
to elevate privileges to root, even if the user is not listed in
the sudoers file. User authentication is not required to exploit
the bug. Sudo versions affected: Sudo versions 1.7.7 through 1.7.10p9, 1.8.2 through 1.8.31p2, and
1.9.0 through 1.9.5p1 are affected. ... â¦ On systems where SELinux is enabled, sudo’s RBAC support allows a
command to be run with a user-specified role and/or type. In order
to transition to the target SELinux security context, sudo runs the command through the sesh helper program. When
sudo is invoked as sudoedit , sesh is used to first
create the editor temporary files with the proper security context
and then, once the editor has run, to copy the edited temporary
files to their original locations. ... â¦ Sudo’s pwfeedback option can be used to provide visual
feedback when the user is inputting their password. For each key
press, an asterisk is printed. This option was added in response
to user confusion over how the standard Password: prompt
disables the echoing of key presses. While pwfeedback is
not enabled by default in the upstream version of sudo, some systems,
such as Linux Mint and Elementary OS, do enable it in their default
sudoers files. ... â¦ When sudo is configured to allow a user to run commands as an arbitrary
user via the ALL keyword in a Runas specification, it is possible
to run commands as root by specifying the user ID -1 or 4294967295. This can be used by a user with sufficient sudo privileges to run
commands as root even if the Runas specification explicitly disallows
root access as long as the ALL keyword is listed first in
the Runas specification. ... â¦ On Linux systems, sudo parses the /proc/[pid]/stat file
to determine the device number of the process’s tty (field 7). The
fields in the file are space-delimited, but it is possible for the
command name (field 2) to include white space (including newline),
which sudo does not account for. A user with sudo privileges can
cause sudo to use a device number of the user’s choosing by creating
a symbolic link from the sudo binary to a name that contains white
space followed by a number. ... â¦ A flaw exists in sudo’s noexec functionality that may allow
a user with sudo privileges to run additional commands even when
the NOEXEC tag has been applied to a command that uses
either the system() or popen() functions. Sudo versions affected: 1.6.8 through 1.8.14p3 inclusive. CVE ID: This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2016-7032 in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database. ... â¦ «« « 1 2 3 4 » »»
