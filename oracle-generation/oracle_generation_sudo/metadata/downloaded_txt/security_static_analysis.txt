Static Analysis | Sudo Static Analysis Static analysis security testing (SAST) is a way of finding flaws
in software without running it in the traditional sense.  Source
code is checked for dangerous patterns and data flow analysis is
performed to find potential errors.  One of the advantages of SAST
is that it is capable of finding errors in code paths that are
unlikely, but still possible, to happen at run-time. Multiple SAST tools are used during sudo development.  Why use more
that one?  Different tools find different classes of issues. Coverity Scan Sudo is scanned using the Coverity static analysis
tool before each release.  You can view a list of defects found,
as well as any pending defects, on the sudo project
page . Coverity Scan is free to use for
Open Source projects. PVS Studio Sudo is also run through the PVS-Studio static code analyzer periodically, usually before a release.  The sudo code base
has been annotated to ignore false positives. PVS Studio is free to use for Open
Source projects, but requires a comment in the source files.
To check sudo with PVS Studio you must
generate a free license key . CodeQL Every Sudo commit is scanned using the CodeQL workflow on GitHub .  You can view the
current defects as well as those that have been fixed on sudo’s Code scanning page .
The workflow history is also available. CodeQL is free for research and open source. Clang Static Analyzer The Clang static analyzer is used periodically to check for defects.  Clang version 14
or higher should be used to avoid a large number of false positives.
The Clang static analyzer is
Open Source, part of the LLVM project. Cppcheck Sudo is also run through the Cppcheck static analysis tool periodically.
The sudo code base has been annotated to ignore some of the
false positives. Cppcheck is Open Source.
