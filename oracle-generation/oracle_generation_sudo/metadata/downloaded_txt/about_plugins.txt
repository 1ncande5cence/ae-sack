Sudo Plugins | Sudo Sudo Plugins Starting with version 1.8.0, sudo supports a modular framework that supports
third-party policy and I/O logging plugins. In this framework,
when a user runs sudo , the front-end queries a policy
plugin to determine whether or not the command is to be allowed.
If it is allowed, the policy plugin returns a description of how
to run the command along with the argument vector and environment
to pass to the execve() system call. While the command
is being run, the I/O plugin, if any, is passed all input to and
output from the command. This makes it possible for third parties to extend sudo without
replacing it. Extending sudo, rather than replacing it outright,
has the advantage of allowing users to maintain their existing work
flow while providing extra features that enterprise users want. Below is a list of known third-party sudo plugins.
If you have developed a plugin and would like to be added to this
list, please send mail to sudo@sudo.ws . Privilege Manager for Sudo The first available third party plugin is Privilege Manager for Sudo ,
which brings advanced features from the Privilege Manager for Unix product to sudo. These features include a central policy server,
centralized management of sudo and the sudoers policy file, centralized
reporting on sudoers access rights and activities, as well as
keystroke logging of activities performed through sudo. Privilege
Manager makes administering sudo across the entire enterprise easy,
intuitive and consistent–eliminating the box-by-box management of
sudo that is the source of so much inefficiency and inconsistency. sudo_pair sudo_pair is an I/O plugin for sudo that can be used to require that another
party approve commands before they are allowed to run. The running
command’s output is mirrored on the approver’s screen and the command
can be terminated by the approver at any point.
