mod_cgi - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_cgi Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Description: Execution of CGI scripts Status: Base ModuleÂ Identifier: cgi_module SourceÂ File: mod_cgi.c Summary Any file that has the handler cgi-script will be treated
    as a CGI script, and run by the server, with its output being
    returned to the client. Files acquire this handler either by
    having a name containing an extension defined by the AddHandler directive, or by being
    in a ScriptAlias directory. For an introduction to using CGI scripts with Apache, see
    our tutorial on Dynamic Content
    With CGI . When using a multi-threaded MPM under unix, the module mod_cgid should be used in place of
    this module. At the user level, the two modules are essentially
    identical. For backward-compatibility, the cgi-script handler will also be activated
    for any file with the mime-type application/x-httpd-cgi . The
    use of the magic mime-type is deprecated. Topics CGI Environment variables CGI Debugging Directives CGIScriptTimeout ScriptLog ScriptLogBuffer ScriptLogLength Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also AcceptPathInfo Options ExecCGI ScriptAlias AddHandler Running CGI programs under different
    user IDs CGI Specification Comments CGI Environment variables The server will set the CGI environment variables as described
    in the CGI specification ,
    with the following provisions: PATH_INFO This will not be available if the AcceptPathInfo directive is explicitly set to off .  The default behavior, if AcceptPathInfo is not given, is that mod_cgi will accept path info (trailing /more/path/info following the script filename in the URI),
      while the core server will return a 404 NOT FOUND error for requests
      with additional path info. Omitting the AcceptPathInfo directive has the same effect as setting
      it On for mod_cgi requests. REMOTE_HOST This will only be set if HostnameLookups is set to on (it
      is off by default), and if a reverse DNS lookup of the accessing
      host's address indeed finds a host name. REMOTE_IDENT This will only be set if IdentityCheck is set to on and the accessing host supports the ident
      protocol. Note that the contents of this variable cannot be
      relied upon because it can easily be faked, and if there is a
      proxy between the client and the server, it is usually
      totally useless. REMOTE_USER This will only be set if the CGI script is subject to
      authentication. This module also leverages the core functions ap_add_common_vars and ap_add_cgi_vars to add environment variables like: DOCUMENT_ROOT Set with the content of the related DocumentRoot directive. SERVER_NAME The fully qualified domain name related to the request. SERVER_ADDR The IP address of the Virtual Host serving the request. SERVER_ADMIN Set with the content of the related ServerAdmin directive. For an exhaustive list it is suggested to write a basic CGI script 
       that dumps all the environment variables passed by Apache in a convenient format. CGI Debugging Debugging CGI scripts has traditionally been difficult, mainly
    because it has not been possible to study the output (standard
    output and error) for scripts which are failing to run
    properly. These directives provide more detailed logging of errors
    when they occur. CGI Logfile Format When configured, the CGI error log logs any CGI which does not
      execute properly. Each CGI script which fails to operate causes
      several lines of information to be logged. The first two lines
      are always of the format: %% [ time ] request-line %% HTTP-status CGI-script-filename If the error is that CGI script cannot be run, the log file
      will contain an extra two lines: %%error error-message Alternatively, if the error is the result of the script
      returning incorrect header information (often due to a bug in
      the script), the following information is logged: %request All HTTP request headers received POST or PUT entity (if any) %response All headers output by the CGI script %stdout CGI standard output %stderr CGI standard error (The %stdout and %stderr parts may be missing if the script did
      not output anything on standard output or standard error). CGIScriptTimeout Directive Description: The length of time to wait for more output from the
CGI program Syntax: CGIScriptTimeout time [s|ms] Default: value of Timeout directive when
unset Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Status: Base Module: mod_cgi Compatibility: Available in version 2.4.59 and later. This directive limits the length of time to wait for more output from
    the CGI program.  If the time is exceeded, the request and CGI are
    terminated. Example CGIScriptTimeout 20 ScriptLog Directive Description: Location of the CGI script error logfile Syntax: ScriptLog file-path Context: server config, virtual host Status: Base Module: mod_cgi , mod_cgid The ScriptLog directive sets the CGI
    script error logfile. If no ScriptLog is given,
    no error log is created. If given, any CGI errors are logged into the
    filename given as argument. If this is a relative file or path it is
    taken relative to the ServerRoot . Example ScriptLog logs/cgi_log This log will be opened as the user the child processes run
    as, i.e. the user specified in the main User directive. This means that
    either the directory the script log is in needs to be writable
    by that user or the file needs to be manually created and set
    to be writable by that user. If you place the script log in
    your main logs directory, do NOT change the
    directory permissions to make it writable by the user the child
    processes run as. Note that script logging is meant to be a debugging feature
    when writing CGI scripts, and is not meant to be activated
    continuously on running servers. It is not optimized for speed
    or efficiency, and may have security problems if used in a
    manner other than that for which it was designed. ScriptLogBuffer Directive Description: Maximum amount of PUT or POST requests that will be recorded
in the scriptlog Syntax: ScriptLogBuffer bytes Default: ScriptLogBuffer 1024 Context: server config, virtual host Status: Base Module: mod_cgi , mod_cgid The size of any PUT or POST entity body that is logged to
    the file is limited, to prevent the log file growing too big
    too quickly if large bodies are being received. By default, up
    to 1024 bytes are logged, but this can be changed with this
    directive. ScriptLogLength Directive Description: Size limit of the CGI script logfile Syntax: ScriptLogLength bytes Default: ScriptLogLength 10385760 Context: server config, virtual host Status: Base Module: mod_cgi , mod_cgid ScriptLogLength can be used to limit the
    size of the CGI script logfile. Since the logfile logs a lot of
    information per CGI error (all request headers, all script output)
    it can grow to be a big file. To prevent problems due to unbounded
    growth, this directive can be used to set an maximum file-size for
    the CGI logfile. If the file exceeds this size, no more
    information will be written to it. Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
