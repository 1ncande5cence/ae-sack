mod_dumpio - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_dumpio Available Languages: en | fr | ja Description: Dumps all I/O to error log as desired. Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: dumpio_module SourceÂ File: mod_dumpio.c Summary mod_dumpio allows for the logging of
    all input received by Apache and/or all output sent by
    Apache to be logged (dumped) to the error.log file. The data logging is done right after SSL decoding (for
    input) and right before SSL encoding (for output). As can
    be expected, this can produce extreme volumes of data,
    and should only be used when debugging problems. Topics Enabling dumpio Support Directives DumpIOInput DumpIOOutput Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also Comments Enabling dumpio Support To enable the module, it should be compiled and loaded
