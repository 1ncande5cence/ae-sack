mod_mime_magic - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_mime_magic Available Languages: en | fr Description: Determines the MIME type of a file
    by looking at a few bytes of its contents Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: mime_magic_module SourceÂ File: mod_mime_magic.c Summary This module determines the MIME
    type of files in the same way the Unix file(1) command works: it looks at the first few
    bytes of the file. It is intended as a "second line of defense"
    for cases that mod_mime can't resolve. This module is derived from a free version of the file(1) command for Unix, which uses "magic
    numbers" and other hints from a file's contents to figure out
    what the contents are. This module is active only if the magic
    file is specified by the MimeMagicFile directive. Topics Format of the Magic File Performance Issues Notes Directives MimeMagicFile Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also Comments Format of the Magic File The contents of the file are plain ASCII text in 4-5
    columns. Blank lines are allowed but ignored. Commented lines
    use a hash mark ( # ). The remaining lines are parsed for
    the following columns: Column Description 1 byte number to begin checking from " > " indicates a dependency upon the previous
         non-" > " line 2 type of data to match byte single character short machine-order 16-bit integer long machine-order 32-bit integer string arbitrary-length string date long integer date (seconds since Unix epoch/1970) beshort big-endian 16-bit integer belong big-endian 32-bit integer bedate big-endian 32-bit integer date leshort little-endian 16-bit integer lelong little-endian 32-bit integer ledate little-endian 32-bit integer date 3 contents of data to match 4 MIME type if matched 5 MIME encoding if matched (optional) For example, the following magic file lines would recognize
    some audio formats: # Sun/NeXT audio data
0      string      .snd
>12    belong      1       audio/basic
>12    belong      2       audio/basic
>12    belong      3       audio/basic
>12    belong      4       audio/basic
>12    belong      5       audio/basic
>12    belong      6       audio/basic
>12    belong      7       audio/basic
>12    belong     23       audio/x-adpcm Or these would recognize the difference between *.doc files containing Microsoft Word or FrameMaker documents. (These are
    incompatible file formats which use the same file suffix.) # Frame
0  string  \<MakerFile        application/x-frame
0  string  \<MIFFile          application/x-frame
0  string  \<MakerDictionary  application/x-frame
0  string  \<MakerScreenFon   application/x-frame
0  string  \<MML              application/x-frame
0  string  \<Book             application/x-frame
0  string  \<Maker            application/x-frame

# MS-Word
0  string  \376\067\0\043            application/msword
0  string  \320\317\021\340\241\261  application/msword
0  string  \333\245-\0\0\0           application/msword An optional MIME encoding can be included as a fifth column.
    For example, this can recognize gzipped files and set the
    encoding for them. # gzip (GNU zip, not to be confused with
#       [Info-ZIP/PKWARE] zip archiver)

0  string  \037\213  application/octet-stream  x-gzip Performance Issues This module is not for every system. If your system is barely
    keeping up with its load or if you're performing a web server
    benchmark, you may not want to enable this because the
    processing is not free. However, an effort was made to improve the performance of
    the original file(1) code to make it fit in a busy web
    server. It was designed for a server where there are thousands of users
    who publish their own documents. This is probably very common
    on intranets. Many times, it's helpful if the server can make
    more intelligent decisions about a file's contents than the
    file name allows ...even if just to reduce the "why doesn't my
    page work" calls when users improperly name their own files.
    You have to decide if the extra work suits your
    environment. Notes The following notes apply to the mod_mime_magic module and are included here for compliance with contributors'

      significantly modified from the free "file" command. all-in-one file for compilation convenience when moving from
        one version of Apache to the next. Memory allocation is done through the Apache API's pool
        structure. All functions have had necessary Apache API request or server
        structures passed to them where necessary to call other Apache API
        routines. ( i.e. , usually for logging, files, or memory
        allocation in itself or a called function.) struct magic has been converted from an array to a single-ended
        linked list because it only grows one record at a time, it's only
        accessed sequentially, and the Apache API has no equivalent of realloc() . Functions have been changed to get their parameters from the
        server configuration instead of globals.  (It should be reentrant
        now but has not been tested in a threaded environment.) Places where it used to print results to stdout now saves them
        in a list where they're used to set the MIME type in the Apache
        request record. Command-line flags have been removed since they will never be
        used here. MimeMagicFile Directive Description: Enable MIME-type determination based on file contents
using the specified magic file Syntax: MimeMagicFile file-path Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_mime_magic The MimeMagicFile directive can be used to
    enable this module, the default file is distributed at conf/magic . Non-rooted paths are relative to the ServerRoot . Virtual hosts will use
    the same file as the main server unless a more specific setting is
    used, in which case the more specific setting overrides the main
    server's file. Example MimeMagicFile conf/magic Available Languages: en | fr Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
