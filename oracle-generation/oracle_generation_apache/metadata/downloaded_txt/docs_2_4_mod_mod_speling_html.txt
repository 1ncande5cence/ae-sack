mod_speling - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_speling Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Description: Attempts to correct mistaken URLs by ignoring
capitalization, or attempting to correct various minor
misspellings. Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: speling_module SourceÂ File: mod_speling.c Summary Requests to documents sometimes cannot be served by the core
    apache server because the request was misspelled or
    miscapitalized. This module addresses this problem by trying to
    find a matching document, even after all other modules gave up.
    It does its work by comparing each document name in the
    requested directory against the requested document name without regard to case , and allowing up to one misspelling (character insertion /
    omission / transposition or wrong character). A list is built
    with all document names which were matched using this
    strategy. Erroneous extension can also be fixed
    by this module. If, after scanning the directory, no matching document was found, Apache will proceed as
      usual and return an error ( 404 - document not found ). only one document is found that "almost" matches the
      request, then it is returned in the form of a redirection
      response ( 301 - Moved Permanently ). more than one document with a close match was found, then
      the list of the matches is returned to the client, and the
      client can select the correct candidate ( 300 - Multiple
      Choices ). Directives CheckBasenameMatch CheckCaseOnly CheckSpelling Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also Comments CheckBasenameMatch Directive Description: Also match files with differing file name extensions. Syntax: CheckBasenameMatch on|off Default: CheckBasenameMatch On Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: Options Status: Extension Module: mod_speling Compatibility: Available in httpd 2.4.50 and later When set, this directive extends the action of the spelling correction
    to the file name extension. For example a file foo.gif will
    match a request for foo or foo.jpg . This can be
    particularly useful in conjunction with MultiViews . CheckCaseOnly Directive Description: Limits the action of the speling module to case corrections Syntax: CheckCaseOnly on|off Default: CheckCaseOnly Off Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: Options Status: Extension Module: mod_speling When set, this directive limits the action of the spelling correction
    to lower/upper case changes.  Other potential corrections are not performed,
    except when CheckBasenameMatch is also set. CheckSpelling Directive Description: Enables the spelling
module Syntax: CheckSpelling on|off Default: CheckSpelling Off Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: Options Status: Extension Module: mod_speling This directive enables or disables the spelling module. When
    enabled, keep in mind that the directory scan which is necessary for the spelling
      correction will have an impact on the server's performance
      when many spelling corrections have to be performed at the
      same time. the document trees should not contain sensitive files
      which could be matched inadvertently by a spelling
      "correction". the module is unable to correct misspelled user names (as
      in http://my.host/~apahce/ ), just file names or
      directory names. spelling corrections apply strictly to existing files, so
      a request for the <Location /status> may
      get incorrectly treated as the negotiated file
      " /stats.html ". mod_speling should not be enabled in DAV enabled directories, because it will try to "spell fix" newly created
    resource names against existing filenames, e.g., when trying to upload
    a new document doc43.html it might redirect to an existing
    document doc34.html , which is not what was intended. Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
