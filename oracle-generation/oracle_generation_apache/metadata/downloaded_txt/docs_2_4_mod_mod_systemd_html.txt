mod_systemd - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_systemd Available Languages: en | fr Description: Provides better support for systemd integration Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: systemd_module SourceÂ File: mod_systemd.c Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.4.42 and later Summary This module provides support for systemd integration. It allows
    httpd to be used in a service with the systemd Type=notify (see systemd.service(5) for more information).  The module is activated if loaded. Example of systemd service unit (more settings are probably needed for production systems) [Unit]
Description=The Apache HTTP Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=notify
ExecStart=/usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd -D FOREGROUND -k start
ExecReload=/usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd -k graceful
KillMode=mixed

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target Special attention should be given to how ExecStop and/or KillMode are configured for the service.  If
   configured, an ExecStop command should be a synchronous operation which itself exits when the daemon
   has terminated.  Running httpd -k stop asynchronously initiates daemon termination, so does not
   satisfy this condition.  The example above uses KillMode=mixed so that systemd sends SIGTERM to signal the parent process (and only the
   parent) to shut down.  The entire process group is then sent SIGKILL after TimeoutStopSec elapses, if
   any processes are still running.  See systemd.kill(5) for more information. This module does not provide support for Systemd socket activation. ExtendedStatus is
    enabled by default if the module is loaded.  If ExtendedStatus is not disabled in
    the configuration, run-time load and request statistics are made
    available in the systemctl status output. Directives This module provides no
            directives. Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also Comments Available Languages: en | fr Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
