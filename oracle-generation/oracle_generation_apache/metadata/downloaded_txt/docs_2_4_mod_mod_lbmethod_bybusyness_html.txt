It requires the services of mod_proxy_balancer , and
provides the bybusyness load balancing method. Topics Pending Request Counting Algorithm Directives This module provides no
            directives. Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also mod_proxy mod_proxy_balancer Comments Pending Request Counting Algorithm Enabled via lbmethod=bybusyness , this scheduler keeps
    track of how many requests each worker is currently assigned at present. A new
    request is automatically assigned to the worker with the lowest
    number of active requests. This is useful in the case of workers
    that queue incoming requests independently of Apache, to ensure that
    queue length stays even and a request is always given to the worker
    most likely to service it the fastest and reduce latency. In the case of multiple least-busy workers, the statistics (and
    weightings) used by the Request Counting method are used to break the
    tie. Over time, the distribution of work will come to resemble that
    characteristic of byrequests (as implemented
    by mod_lbmethod_byrequests ). Available Languages: en | fr Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
