mod_cache_socache - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_cache_socache Available Languages: en | fr Description: Shared object cache (socache) based storage module for the
HTTP caching filter. Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: cache_socache_module SourceÂ File: mod_cache_socache.c Summary mod_cache_socache implements a shared object cache
    (socache) based storage manager for mod_cache . The headers and bodies of cached responses are combined, and stored
    underneath a single key in the shared object cache. A number of implementations of shared object
    caches are available to choose from. Multiple content negotiated responses can be stored concurrently,
    however the caching of partial content is not yet supported by this
    module. # Turn on caching

    the shared object cache implementation to use, followed by optional
    arguments for that implementation. A number of
    implementations of shared object caches are available to choose
    from. CacheSocache shmcb CacheSocacheMaxSize Directive Description: The maximum size (in bytes) of an entry to be placed in the
cache Syntax: CacheSocacheMaxSize bytes Default: CacheSocacheMaxSize 102400 Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Status: Extension Module: mod_cache_socache Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.4.5 and later The CacheSocacheMaxSize directive sets the
    maximum size, in bytes, for the combined headers and body of a document
    to be considered for storage in the cache. The larger the headers that
    are stored alongside the body, the smaller the body may be. The mod_cache_socache module will only attempt to
    cache responses that have an explicit content length, or that are small
    enough to be written in one pass. This is done to allow the mod_cache_disk module to have an opportunity to cache
    responses larger than those cacheable within mod_cache_socache . CacheSocacheMaxSize 102400 CacheSocacheMaxTime Directive Description: The maximum time (in seconds) for a document to be placed in the
cache Syntax: CacheSocacheMaxTime seconds Default: CacheSocacheMaxTime 86400 Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Status: Extension Module: mod_cache_socache Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.4.5 and later The CacheSocacheMaxTime directive sets the
    maximum freshness lifetime, in seconds, for a document to be stored in
    the cache. This value overrides the freshness lifetime defined for the
    document by the HTTP protocol. CacheSocacheMaxTime 86400 CacheSocacheMinTime Directive Description: The minimum time (in seconds) for a document to be placed in the
cache Syntax: CacheSocacheMinTime seconds Default: CacheSocacheMinTime 600 Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Status: Extension Module: mod_cache_socache Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.4.5 and later The CacheSocacheMinTime directive sets the
    amount of seconds beyond the freshness lifetime of the response that the
    response should be cached for in the shared object cache. If a response is
    only stored for its freshness lifetime, there will be no opportunity to
    revalidate the response to make it fresh again. CacheSocacheMinTime 600 CacheSocacheReadSize Directive Description: The minimum size (in bytes) of the document to read and be cached
  before sending the data downstream Syntax: CacheSocacheReadSize bytes Default: CacheSocacheReadSize 0 Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Status: Extension Module: mod_cache_socache Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.4.5 and later The CacheSocacheReadSize directive sets the
    minimum amount of data, in bytes, to be read from the backend before the
    data is sent to the client. The default of zero causes all data read of
    any size to be passed downstream to the client immediately as it arrives.
    Setting this to a higher value causes the disk cache to buffer at least
    this amount before sending the result to the client. This can improve
    performance when caching content from a slow reverse proxy. This directive only takes effect when the data is being saved to the
    cache, as opposed to data being served from the cache. CacheSocacheReadSize 102400 CacheSocacheReadTime Directive Description: The minimum time (in milliseconds) that should elapse while reading
  before data is sent downstream Syntax: CacheSocacheReadTime milliseconds Default: CacheSocacheReadTime 0 Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Status: Extension Module: mod_cache_socache Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.4.5 and later The CacheSocacheReadTime directive sets the minimum amount
    of elapsed time that should pass before making an attempt to send data
    downstream to the client. During the time period, data will be buffered
    before sending the result to the client. This can improve performance when
    caching content from a reverse proxy. The default of zero disables this option. This directive only takes effect when the data is being saved to the
    cache, as opposed to data being served from the cache. It is recommended
    that this option be used alongside the CacheSocacheReadSize directive
    to ensure that the server does not buffer excessively should data arrive faster
    than expected. CacheSocacheReadTime 1000 Available Languages: en | fr Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
