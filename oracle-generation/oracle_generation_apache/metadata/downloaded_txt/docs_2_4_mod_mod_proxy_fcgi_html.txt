mod_proxy_fcgi - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_proxy_fcgi Available Languages: en | fr Description: FastCGI support module for mod_proxy Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: proxy_fcgi_module SourceÂ File: mod_proxy_fcgi.c Compatibility: Available in version 2.3 and later Summary This module requires the service of mod_proxy . It provides support for the FastCGI protocol. Thus, in order to get the ability of handling the FastCGI protocol, mod_proxy and mod_proxy_fcgi have to be present in the server. Unlike mod_fcgid and mod_fastcgi , mod_proxy_fcgi has no provision for starting the
    application process; fcgistarter is provided
    (on some platforms) for that purpose. Alternatively, external launching
    or process management may be available in the FastCGI application
    framework in use. Warning Do not enable proxying until you have secured your server . Open proxy
      servers are dangerous both to your network and to the Internet at
      large. Topics Examples Environment Variables Directives ProxyFCGIBackendType ProxyFCGISetEnvIf Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also fcgistarter mod_proxy mod_authnz_fcgi Comments Examples Remember, in order to make the following examples work, you have to
    enable mod_proxy and mod_proxy_fcgi . Single application instance ProxyPass "/myapp/" "fcgi://localhost:4000/" mod_proxy_fcgi disables connection reuse by
    default, so after a request has been completed the connection will NOT be
    held open by that httpd child process and won't be reused.  If the
    FastCGI application is able to handle concurrent connections
    from httpd, you can opt-in to connection reuse as shown in the following
    example: Single application instance, connection reuse (2.4.11 and later) ProxyPass "/myapp/" "fcgi://localhost:4000/" enablereuse=on Enable connection reuse to a FCGI backend like PHP-FPM Please keep in mind that PHP-FPM (at the time of writing, February 2018)
    uses a prefork model, namely each of its worker processes can handle one
    connection at the time. By default mod_proxy (configured with enablereuse=on )
    allows a connection pool of ThreadsPerChild connections to the
    backend for each httpd process when using a threaded mpm (like worker or event ),
    so the following use cases should be taken into account: Under HTTP/1.1 load it will likely cause the creation of up to MaxRequestWorkers connections to the FCGI backend. Under HTTP/2 load, due to how mod_http2 is implemented,
      there are additional h2 worker threads that may force the creation of other
      backend connections. The overall count of connections in the pools may raise
      to more than MaxRequestWorkers . The maximum number of PHP-FPM worker processes needs to be configured wisely,
    since there is the chance that they will all end up "busy" handling idle
    persistent connections, without any room for new ones to be established,
    and the end user experience will be a pile of HTTP request timeouts. The following example passes the request URI as a filesystem
    path for the PHP-FPM daemon to run. The request URL is implicitly added
    to the 2nd parameter. The hostname and port following fcgi:// are where
    PHP-FPM is listening.  Connection pooling/reuse is enabled. PHP-FPM ProxyPassMatch "^/myapp/.*\.php(/.*)?$" "fcgi://localhost:9000/var/www/" enablereuse=on The following example passes the request URI as a filesystem
    path for the PHP-FPM daemon to run. In this case, PHP-FPM is listening on
    a unix domain socket (UDS).  Requires 2.4.9 or later. With this syntax,
    the hostname and optional port following fcgi:// are ignored. PHP-FPM with UDS ProxyPassMatch "^/(.*\.php(/.*)?)$" "unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/var/www/" The balanced gateway needs mod_proxy_balancer and
    at least one load balancer algorithm module, such as mod_lbmethod_byrequests , in addition to the proxy
    modules listed above. mod_lbmethod_byrequests is the
    default, and will be used for this example configuration. Balanced gateway to multiple application instances ProxyPass "/myapp/" "balancer://myappcluster/"
<Proxy "balancer://myappcluster/">
    BalancerMember "fcgi://localhost:4000"
    BalancerMember "fcgi://localhost:4001"
</Proxy> You can also force a request to be handled as a reverse-proxy
        request, by creating a suitable Handler pass-through. The example
        configuration below will pass all requests for PHP scripts to the
        specified FastCGI server using reverse proxy.
        This feature is available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.10 and later. For performance
       reasons, you will want to define a worker representing the same fcgi:// backend. The benefit of this form is that it
       allows the normal mapping of URI to filename to occur in the server, and the
       local filesystem result is passed to the backend.  When FastCGI is
       configured this way, the server can calculate the most accurate
       PATH_INFO. Proxy via Handler <FilesMatch "\.php$">
    # Note: The only part that varies is /path/to/app.sock
    SetHandler  "proxy:unix:/path/to/app.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
</FilesMatch>

# Define a matching worker.
# The part that is matched to the SetHandler is the part that
# follows the pipe. If you need to distinguish, "localhost; can
# be anything unique.
<Proxy "fcgi://localhost/" enablereuse=on max=10>
</Proxy>

<FilesMatch ...>
    SetHandler  "proxy:fcgi://localhost:9000"
</FilesMatch>

<FilesMatch ...>
    SetHandler  "proxy:balancer://myappcluster/"
</FilesMatch> Environment Variables In addition to the configuration directives that control the
    behaviour of mod_proxy , there are a number of environment variables that control the FCGI protocol
    provider: proxy-fcgi-pathinfo When configured via ProxyPass or ProxyPassMatch , mod_proxy_fcgi will not
        set the PATH_INFO environment variable. This allows
        the backend FCGI server to correctly determine SCRIPT_NAME and Script-URI and be compliant with RFC 3875 section 3.3.
        If instead you need mod_proxy_fcgi to generate
        a "best guess" for PATH_INFO , set this env-var.
        This is a workaround for a bug in some FCGI implementations.  This
        variable can be set to multiple values to tweak at how the best guess
        is chosen (In 2.4.11 and later only): first-dot PATH_INFO is split from the slash following the first "." in the URL. last-dot PATH_INFO is split from the slash following the last "." in the URL. full PATH_INFO is calculated by an attempt to map the URL to the
              local filesystem. unescape PATH_INFO is the path component of the URL, unescaped /
              decoded. any other value PATH_INFO is the same as the path component of the URL.
              Originally, this was the only proxy-fcgi-pathinfo option. ProxyFCGIBackendType Directive Description: Specify the type of backend FastCGI application Syntax: ProxyFCGIBackendType FPM|GENERIC Default: ProxyFCGIBackendType FPM Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy_fcgi Compatibility: Available in version 2.4.26 and later This directive allows the type of backend FastCGI application to be
specified. Some FastCGI servers, such as PHP-FPM,  use historical quirks of
environment variables to identify the type of proxy server being used.  Set
this directive to "GENERIC" if your non PHP-FPM application has trouble
interpreting environment variables such as SCRIPT_FILENAME or PATH_TRANSLATED
as set by the server. One example of values that change based on the setting of this directive is
SCRIPT_FILENAME. When using mod_proxy_fcgi historically,
SCRIPT_FILENAME was prefixed with the string "proxy:fcgi://". This variable is
what some generic FastCGI applications would read as their script input, but
PHP-FPM would strip the prefix then remember it was talking to Apache.  In
2.4.21 through 2.4.25, this prefix was automatically stripped by the server,
breaking the ability of PHP-FPM to detect and interoperate with Apache in some
scenarios. ProxyFCGISetEnvIf Directive Description: Allow variables sent to FastCGI servers to be fixed up Syntax: ProxyFCGISetEnvIf conditional-expression [!] environment-variable-name [ value-expression ] Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy_fcgi Compatibility: Available in version 2.4.26 and later Just before passing a request to the configured FastCGI server, the core of
the web server sets a number of environment variables based on details of the
current request. FastCGI programs often uses these environment variables
as inputs that determine what underlying scripts they will process, or what
output they directly produce. Examples of noteworthy environment variables are: SCRIPT_NAME SCRIPT_FILENAME REQUEST_URI PATH_INFO PATH_TRANSLATED This directive allows the environment variables above, or any others of
interest, to be overridden.  This directive is evaluated after the initial
values for these variables are set, so they can be used as input into both
the condition expressions and value expressions. Parameter syntax: conditional-expression Specifies an expression that controls whether the environment variable that
   follows will be modified.  For information on the expression syntax, see
   the examples that follow or the full specification at the ap_expr documentation. environment-variable-name Specifies the CGI environment variable to change,
   such as PATH_INFO. If preceded by an exclamation point, the variable 
   will be unset. value-expression Specifies the replacement value for the preceding environment variable.
   Backreferences, such as "$1", can be included from regular expression
   captures in conditional-expression . If omitted, the variable is
   set (or overridden) to an empty string â but see the Note below. # A basic, unconditional override
ProxyFCGISetEnvIf "true" PATH_INFO "/example"

# Use an environment variable in the value
ProxyFCGISetEnvIf "true" PATH_INFO "%{reqenv:SCRIPT_NAME}"

# Use captures in the conditions and backreferences in the replacement
ProxyFCGISetEnvIf "reqenv('PATH_TRANSLATED') =~ m|(/.*prefix)(\d+)(.*)|" PATH_TRANSLATED "$1$3" Note: Unset vs. Empty The following will unset VARIABLE , preventing it from being sent
  to the FastCGI server: ProxyFCGISetEnvIf true !VARIABLE Whereas the following will erase any existing value of VARIABLE (by setting it to the empty string), but the empty VARIABLE will still be sent to the server: ProxyFCGISetEnvIf true VARIABLE The CGI/1.1 specification does not
  distinguish between a variable with an empty value and a variable that
  does not exist. However, many CGI and FastCGI implementations distinguish (or
  allow scripts to distinguish) between the two. The choice of which to use is
  dependent upon your implementation and your reason for modifying the variable. Available Languages: en | fr Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
