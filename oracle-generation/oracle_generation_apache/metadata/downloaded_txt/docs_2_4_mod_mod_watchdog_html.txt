    tasks Status: Base ModuleÂ Identifier: watchdog_module SourceÂ File: mod_watchdog.c Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.3 and later Summary mod_watchdog defines programmatic hooks for other modules to
periodically run tasks.  These modules can register handlers for mod_watchdog hooks.  Currently, the following modules in the
Apache distribution use this functionality: mod_heartbeat mod_heartmonitor mod_md mod_proxy_hcheck To allow a module to use mod_watchdog functionality, mod_watchdog itself must be statically linked to the server
core or, if a dynamic module, be loaded before the calling module.
