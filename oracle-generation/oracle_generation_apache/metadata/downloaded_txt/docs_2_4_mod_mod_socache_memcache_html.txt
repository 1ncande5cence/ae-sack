Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: socache_memcache_module SourceÂ File: mod_socache_memcache.c Summary mod_socache_memcache is a shared object cache provider
    which provides for creation and access to a cache backed by the memcached high-performance, distributed memory object caching system. This shared object cache provider's "create" method requires a 
       comma separated list of memcached host/port specifications. If using
       this provider via another modules configuration (such as SSLSessionCache ), provide
       the list of servers as the optional "arg" parameter. SSLSessionCache memcache:memcache.example.com:12345,memcache2.example.com:12345 Details of other shared object cache providers can be found here . Directives MemcacheConnTTL Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also Comments MemcacheConnTTL Directive Description: Keepalive time for idle connections Syntax: MemcacheConnTTL num[units] Default: MemcacheConnTTL 15s Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_socache_memcache Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.4.17 and later Set the time to keep idle connections with the memcache server(s)
    alive (threaded platforms only). Valid values for MemcacheConnTTL are times
    up to one hour. 0 means no timeout. This timeout defaults to units of seconds, but accepts
    suffixes for milliseconds (ms), seconds (s), minutes (min), and hours (h). Before Apache 2.4.17, this timeout was hardcoded and its value was 600 usec.
    So, the closest configuration to match the legacy behaviour is to set MemcacheConnTTL to 1ms. # Set a timeout of 10 minutes
MemcacheConnTTL 10min
# Set a timeout of 60 seconds
