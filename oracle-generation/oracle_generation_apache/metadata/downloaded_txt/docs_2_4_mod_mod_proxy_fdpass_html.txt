mod_proxy_fdpass - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_proxy_fdpass Available Languages: en | fr Description: fdpass external process support module for mod_proxy Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: proxy_fdpass_module SourceÂ File: mod_proxy_fdpass.c Compatibility: Available for unix in version 2.3 and later Summary This module requires the service of mod_proxy . It provides support for the passing the socket of the
    client to another process. mod_proxy_fdpass uses the ability of AF_UNIX domain
    sockets to pass an
    open file descriptor to allow another process to finish handling a request. The module has a proxy_fdpass_flusher provider interface,
    which allows another module to optionally send the response headers, or even
    the start of the response body.  The default flush provider
    disables keep-alive, and sends the response headers, letting the external
    process just send a response body. In order to use another provider, you have to set the flusher parameter in the ProxyPass directive. At this time the only data passed to the external process is the client
    socket. To receive a client socket, call recvfrom with an allocated struct cmsghdr . Future versions of this module may include
    more data after the client socket, but this is not implemented at this time. Directives This module provides no
            directives. Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also mod_proxy Comments Available Languages: en | fr Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
