HTTP headers Status: Base ModuleÂ Identifier: asis_module SourceÂ File: mod_asis.c Summary This module provides the handler send-as-is which causes Apache HTTP Server to send the document without adding most of
    the usual HTTP headers. This can be used to send any kind of data from the server,
    including redirects and other special HTTP responses, without
    requiring a cgi-script or an nph script. For historical reasons, this module will also process any
    file with the mime type httpd/send-as-is . Topics Usage Directives This module provides no
            directives. Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also mod_headers mod_cern_meta Apache httpd's Handler Use Comments Usage In the server configuration file, associate files with the send-as-is handler e.g. AddHandler send-as-is asis The contents of any file with a .asis extension
    will then be sent by Apache httpd to the client with almost no
    changes. In particular, HTTP headers are derived from the file
    itself according to mod_cgi rules, so an asis
    file must include valid headers, and may also use the CGI Status: header to determine the HTTP response
    code. The Content-Length: header will automatically
    be inserted or, if included, corrected by httpd. Here's an example of a file whose contents are sent as
    is so as to tell the client that a file has
    redirected. Status: 301 Now where did I leave that URL Location: http://xyz.example.com/foo/bar.html Content-type: text/html <html> <head> <title>Lame excuses'R'us</title> </head> <body> <h1>Fred's exceptionally wonderful page has moved to <a href="http://xyz.example.com/foo/bar.html">Joe's</a>
      site. </h1> </body> </html> Notes: The server always adds a Date: and Server: header to the data returned to the client, so these should not be
    included in the file. The server does not add a Last-Modified header; it probably should. Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
