mod_env - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_env Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko | tr Description: Modifies the environment which is passed to CGI scripts and
SSI pages Status: Base ModuleÂ Identifier: env_module SourceÂ File: mod_env.c Summary This module allows for control of internal environment variables that
    are used by various Apache HTTP Server modules. These variables are also
    provided to CGI scripts as native system environment variables, and available
    for use in SSI pages. Environment variables may be passed from the shell
    which invoked the httpd process. Alternatively,
    environment variables may be set or unset within the configuration process.

... Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: FileInfo Status: Base Module: mod_env Specifies one or more native system environment variables to make available
    as internal environment variables, which are available to Apache HTTP Server modules
    as well as propagated to CGI scripts and SSI pages. Values come from the
    native OS environment of the shell which invoked the httpd process. Example PassEnv LD_LIBRARY_PATH SetEnv Directive Description: Sets environment variables Syntax: SetEnv env-variable [ value ] Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: FileInfo Status: Base Module: mod_env Sets an internal environment variable, which is then available to Apache
    HTTP Server modules, and passed on to CGI scripts and SSI pages. Example SetEnv SPECIAL_PATH /foo/bin If you omit the value argument, the variable is set to
    an empty string. The internal environment variables set by this directive are set after most early request processing directives are run, such as access
    control and URI-to-filename mapping.  If the environment variable you're
    setting is meant as input into this early phase of processing such as the RewriteRule directive, you should
    instead set the environment variable with SetEnvIf . See also Environment Variables UnsetEnv Directive Description: Removes variables from the environment Syntax: UnsetEnv env-variable [ env-variable ]
... Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: FileInfo Status: Base Module: mod_env Removes one or more internal environment variables from those passed
    on to CGI scripts and SSI pages. Example UnsetEnv LD_LIBRARY_PATH Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko | tr Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
