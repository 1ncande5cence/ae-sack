mod_heartbeat - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_heartbeat Available Languages: en | fr Description: Sends messages with server status to frontend proxy Status: Experimental ModuleÂ Identifier: heartbeat_module SourceÂ File: mod_heartbeat Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.3 and later Summary mod_heartbeat sends multicast messages to a mod_heartmonitor listener 
that advertises the servers current connection count.  Usually, mod_heartmonitor will be running on a proxy server with mod_lbmethod_heartbeat loaded, which allows ProxyPass to use the "heartbeat" lbmethod inside
of ProxyPass . mod_heartbeat itself is loaded on the origin server(s) that serve requests 
    through the proxy server(s). To use mod_heartbeat , mod_status and mod_watchdog must be either a static modules or, if a dynamic module, must
        be loaded before mod_heartbeat . Topics Consuming mod_heartbeat Output Directives HeartbeatAddress Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also Comments Consuming mod_heartbeat Output Every 1 second, this module generates a single multicast UDP
      packet, containing the number of busy and idle workers.  The
      packet is a simple ASCII format, similar to GET query parameters
      in HTTP. An Example Packet v=1&ready=75&busy=0 Consumers should handle new variables besides busy and ready,
    separated by '&', being added in the future. HeartbeatAddress Directive Description: Multicast address for heartbeat packets Syntax: HeartbeatAddress addr:port Default: disabled Context: server config Status: Experimental Module: mod_heartbeat The HeartbeatAddress directive specifies the
multicast address to which mod_heartbeat will send
status information. This address will usually correspond to a configured HeartbeatListen on a
frontend proxy system. HeartbeatAddress 239.0.0.1:27999 Available Languages: en | fr Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
