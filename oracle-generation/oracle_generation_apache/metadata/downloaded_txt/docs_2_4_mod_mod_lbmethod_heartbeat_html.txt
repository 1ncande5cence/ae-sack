mod_lbmethod_heartbeat - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_lbmethod_heartbeat Available Languages: en | fr Description: Heartbeat Traffic Counting load balancer scheduler algorithm for mod_proxy_balancer Status: Experimental ModuleÂ Identifier: lbmethod_heartbeat_module SourceÂ File: mod_lbmethod_heartbeat.c Compatibility: Available in version 2.3 and later Summary lbmethod=heartbeat uses the services of mod_heartmonitor to balance between origin servers that are providing
heartbeat info via the mod_heartbeat module. This modules load balancing algorithm favors servers with more ready (idle)
capacity over time, but does not select the server with the most ready capacity
every time.  Servers that have 0 active clients are penalized, with the
assumption that they are not fully initialized.
