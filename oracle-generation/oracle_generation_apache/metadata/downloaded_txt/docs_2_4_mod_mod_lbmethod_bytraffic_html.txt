mod_lbmethod_bytraffic - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_lbmethod_bytraffic Available Languages: en | fr Description: Weighted Traffic Counting load balancer scheduler algorithm for mod_proxy_balancer Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: lbmethod_bytraffic_module SourceÂ File: mod_lbmethod_bytraffic.c Compatibility: Split off from mod_proxy_balancer in 2.3 Summary This module does not provide any configuration directives of its own.
It requires the services of mod_proxy_balancer , and
provides the bytraffic load balancing method. Topics Weighted Traffic Counting Algorithm Directives This module provides no
            directives. Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also mod_proxy mod_proxy_balancer Comments Weighted Traffic Counting Algorithm Enabled via lbmethod=bytraffic , the idea behind this
    scheduler is very similar to the Request Counting method, with
    the following changes: lbfactor is how much traffic, in bytes, we want
    this worker to handle . This is also a normalized value
    representing their "share" of the amount of work to be done,
    but instead of simply counting the number of requests, we take
    into account the amount of traffic this worker has either seen
    or produced. If a balancer is configured as follows: worker a b c lbfactor 1 2 1 Then we mean that we want b to process twice the
    amount of bytes than a or c should. It does
    not necessarily mean that b would handle twice as
    many requests, but it would process twice the I/O. Thus, the
    size of the request and response are applied to the weighting
    and selection algorithm. Note: input and output bytes are weighted the same. Available Languages: en | fr Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
