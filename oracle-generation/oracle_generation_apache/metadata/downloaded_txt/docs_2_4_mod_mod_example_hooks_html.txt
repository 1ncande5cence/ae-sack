mod_example_hooks - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_example_hooks Available Languages: en | fr | ko Description: Illustrates the Apache module API Status: Experimental ModuleÂ Identifier: example_hooks_module SourceÂ File: mod_example_hooks.c Summary The files in the modules/examples directory
    under the Apache distribution directory tree are provided as an
    example to those that wish to write modules that use the Apache
    API. The main file is mod_example_hooks.c , which
    illustrates all the different callback mechanisms and call
    syntaxes. By no means does an add-on module need to include
    routines for all of the callbacks - quite the contrary! The example module is an actual working module. If you link
    it into your server, enable the "example-hooks-handler" handler for a
    location, and then browse to that location, you will see a
    display of some of the tracing the example module did as the
    various callbacks were made. Topics Compiling the example_hooks module Using the mod_example_hooks Module Directives Example Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also Comments Compiling the example_hooks module To include the example_hooks module in your server, follow the
    steps below: Run configure with --enable-example-hooks option. Make the server (run " make "). To add another module of your own: cp modules/examples/mod_example_hooks.c
      modules/new_module/ mod_myexample.c Modify the file. Create modules/new_module/config.m4 . Add APACHE_MODPATH_INIT(new_module) . Copy APACHE_MODULE line with "example_hooks" from modules/examples/config.m4 . Replace the first argument "example_hooks" with myexample . Replace the second argument with brief description of your module.
            It will be used in configure --help . If your module needs additional C compiler flags, linker flags or
            libraries, add them to CFLAGS, LDFLAGS and LIBS accordingly.
            See other config.m4 files in modules directory for
            examples. Add APACHE_MODPATH_FINISH . Create module/new_module/Makefile.in .
      If your module doesn't need special build instructions,
      all you need to have in that file is include $(top_srcdir)/build/special.mk . Run ./buildconf from the top-level directory. Build the server with --enable-myexample Using the mod_example_hooks Module To activate the example_hooks module, include a block similar to
    the following in your httpd.conf file: <Location "/example-hooks-info">
   SetHandler example-hooks-handler
</Location> As an alternative, you can put the following into a .htaccess file
    and then request the file "test.example" from that location: AddHandler example-hooks-handler ".example" After reloading/restarting your server, you should be able
    to browse to this location and see the brief display mentioned
    earlier. Example Directive Description: Demonstration directive to illustrate the Apache module
API Syntax: Example Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Status: Experimental Module: mod_example_hooks The Example directive just sets a demonstration
    flag which the example module's content handler displays. It
    takes no arguments. If you browse to an URL to which the
    example-hooks content-handler applies, you will get a display of the
    routines within the module and how and in what order they were
    called to service the document request. The effect of this
    directive one can observe under the point " Example
    directive declared here: YES/NO ". Available Languages: en | fr | ko Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
