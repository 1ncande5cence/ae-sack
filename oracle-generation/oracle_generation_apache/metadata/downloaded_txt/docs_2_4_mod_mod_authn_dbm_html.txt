mod_authn_dbm - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_authn_dbm Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Description: User authentication using DBM files Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: authn_dbm_module SourceÂ File: mod_authn_dbm.c Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.1 and later Summary This module provides authentication front-ends such as mod_auth_digest and mod_auth_basic to authenticate users by looking up users in dbm password
    files. Similar functionality is provided by mod_authn_file . When using mod_auth_basic or mod_auth_digest , this module is invoked via the AuthBasicProvider or AuthDigestProvider with the dbm value.

store passwords Syntax: AuthDBMType default|SDBM|GDBM|NDBM|DB Default: AuthDBMType default Context: directory, .htaccess Override: AuthConfig Status: Extension Module: mod_authn_dbm Sets the type of database file that is used to store the passwords.
    The default database type is determined at compile time. The
    availability of other types of database files also depends on compile-time settings . For example, in order to enable the support for Berkeley DB
    (correspondent to the db type) the --with-berkeley-db option needs to be added to httpd's
    configure to generate the necessary DSO. It is crucial that whatever program you use to create your password
    files is configured to use the same type of database. AuthDBMUserFile Directive Description: Sets the name of a database file containing the list of users and
passwords for authentication Syntax: AuthDBMUserFile file-path Context: directory, .htaccess Override: AuthConfig Status: Extension Module: mod_authn_dbm The AuthDBMUserFile directive sets the
    name of a DBM file containing the list of users and passwords for
    user authentication. File-path is the absolute path to
    the user file. The user file is keyed on the username. The value for a user is
    the encrypted password, optionally followed by a colon and arbitrary
    data. The colon and the data following it will be ignored by the
    server. Security: Make sure that the AuthDBMUserFile is stored
      outside the document tree of the web-server; do not put it in
      the directory that it protects. Otherwise, clients will be able to
      download the AuthDBMUserFile . The encrypted password format depends on which authentication
    frontend (e.g. mod_auth_basic or mod_auth_digest ) is being used.  See Password Formats for
    more information. Important compatibility note: The implementation of dbmopen in the Apache modules reads the string length of
    the hashed values from the DBM data structures, rather than relying
    upon the string being NULL-appended. Some applications, such as
    the Netscape web server, rely upon the string being
    NULL-appended, so if you are having trouble using DBM files
    interchangeably between applications this may be a part of the
    problem. A perl script called dbmmanage is included with
    Apache. This program can be used to create and update DBM
    format password files for use with this module. Another
    tool for maintaining the DBM files is the included program htdbm . Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
