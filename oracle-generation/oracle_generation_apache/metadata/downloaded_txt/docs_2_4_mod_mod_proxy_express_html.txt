mod_proxy_express - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_proxy_express Available Languages: en | fr Description: Dynamic mass reverse proxy extension for mod_proxy Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: proxy_express_module SourceÂ File: mod_proxy_express.c Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.3.13 and later Summary This module creates dynamically configured mass reverse
    proxies, by mapping the Host: header of the HTTP request to
    a server name and backend URL stored in a DBM file.
    This allows for easy use of a huge number of reverse proxies
    with no configuration changes. It is much less feature-full
    than mod_proxy_balancer , which also provides
    dynamic growth, but is intended to handle much, much
    larger numbers of backends. It is ideally suited as a
    front-end HTTP switch and for micro-services architectures. This module requires the service of mod_proxy . Warning Do not enable proxying until you have secured your server . Open proxy
      servers are dangerous both to your network and to the Internet at
      large. Limitations This module is not intended to replace the dynamic capability of mod_proxy_balancer . Instead, it is intended to be mostly
      a lightweight and fast alternative to using mod_rewrite with RewriteMap and the [P] flag for mapped reverse proxying. It does not support regex or pattern matching at all. It emulates: <VirtualHost *:80>
   ServerName front.end.server
   ProxyPass        "/" "back.end.server:port"
   ProxyPassReverse "/" "back.end.server:port"
</VirtualHost> That is, the entire URL is appended to the mapped backend
      URL. This is in keeping with the intent of being a simple
      but fast reverse proxy switch.

Syntax: ProxyExpressDBMFile pathname Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy_express The ProxyExpressDBMFile directive
    points to the location of the Express map DBM file. This
    file serves to map the incoming server name, obtained from
    the Host: header, to a backend URL. Note The file is constructed from a plain text file format using
        the httxt2dbm utility. ProxyExpress map file ## ##express-map.txt: ## www1.example.com   http://192.168.211.2:8080 www2.example.com   http://192.168.211.12:8088 www3.example.com   http://192.168.212.10 Create DBM file httxt2dbm -i express-map.txt -o emap Configuration ProxyExpressEnable on

    controls whether the module will be active. Available Languages: en | fr Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
