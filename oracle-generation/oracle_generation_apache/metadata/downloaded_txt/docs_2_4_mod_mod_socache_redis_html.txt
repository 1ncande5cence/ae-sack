Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: socache_redis_module SourceÂ File: mod_socache_redis.c Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.4.39 and later Summary mod_socache_redis is a shared object cache provider
    which provides for creation and access to a cache backed by the Redis high-performance, distributed memory object caching system. This shared object cache provider's "create" method requires a
       comma separated list of memcached host/port specifications. If using
       this provider via another modules configuration (such as SSLSessionCache ), provide
       the list of servers as the optional "arg" parameter. SSLSessionCache redis:redis.example.com:12345,redis2.example.com:12345 Details of other shared object cache providers can be found here .
