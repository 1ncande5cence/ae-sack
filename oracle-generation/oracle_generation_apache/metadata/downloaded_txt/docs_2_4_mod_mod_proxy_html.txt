mod_proxy - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_proxy Available Languages: en | fr | ja Description: Multi-protocol proxy/gateway server Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: proxy_module SourceÂ File: mod_proxy.c Summary Warning Do not enable proxying with ProxyRequests until you have secured your server . Open proxy servers are dangerous both to your
      network and to the Internet at large. mod_proxy and related modules implement a
    proxy/gateway for Apache HTTP Server, supporting a number of popular
    protocols as well as several different load balancing algorithms.
    Third-party modules can add support for additional protocols and
    load balancing algorithms. A set of modules must be loaded into the server to provide the
    necessary features.  These modules can be included statically at
    build time or dynamically via the LoadModule directive).
    The set must include: mod_proxy , which provides basic proxy
      capabilities mod_proxy_balancer and one or more
      balancer modules if load balancing is required.  (See mod_proxy_balancer for more information.) one or more proxy scheme, or protocol, modules: Protocol Module AJP13 (Apache JServe Protocol version

    Caching is provided by mod_cache and related
    modules.  The ability to contact remote servers using the SSL/TLS
    protocol is provided by the SSLProxy* directives of mod_ssl .  These additional modules will need
    to be loaded and configured to take advantage of these features. Topics Forward Proxies and Reverse

       Proxies/Gateways Apache HTTP Server can be configured in both a forward and reverse proxy (also known as gateway ) mode. An ordinary forward proxy is an intermediate
      server that sits between the client and the origin
      server .  In order to get content from the origin server,
      the client sends a request to the proxy naming the origin server
      as the target. The proxy then requests the content from the
      origin server and returns it to the client.  The client must be
      specially configured to use the forward proxy to access other
      sites. A typical usage of a forward proxy is to provide Internet
      access to internal clients that are otherwise restricted by a
      firewall.  The forward proxy can also use caching (as provided
      by mod_cache ) to reduce network usage. The forward proxy is activated using the ProxyRequests directive.  Because
      forward proxies allow clients to access arbitrary sites through
      your server and to hide their true origin, it is essential that
      you secure your server so that only
      authorized clients can access the proxy before activating a
      forward proxy. A reverse proxy (or gateway ), by
      contrast, appears to the client just like an ordinary web
      server.  No special configuration on the client is necessary.
      The client makes ordinary requests for content in the namespace
      of the reverse proxy.  The reverse proxy then decides where to
      send those requests and returns the content as if it were itself
      the origin. A typical usage of a reverse proxy is to provide Internet
      users access to a server that is behind a firewall.  Reverse
      proxies can also be used to balance load among several back-end
      servers or to provide caching for a slower back-end server.
      In addition, reverse proxies can be used simply to bring
      several servers into the same URL space. A reverse proxy is activated using the ProxyPass directive or the [P] flag to the RewriteRule directive.  It is not necessary to turn ProxyRequests on in order to
      configure a reverse proxy. Basic Examples The examples below are only a very basic idea to help you
    get started.  Please read the documentation on the individual
    directives. In addition, if you wish to have caching enabled, consult
    the documentation from mod_cache . Reverse Proxy ProxyPass "/foo" "http://foo.example.com/bar"
ProxyPassReverse "/foo" "http://foo.example.com/bar" Forward Proxy ProxyRequests On
ProxyVia On

<Proxy "*">
  Require host internal.example.com
</Proxy> Websocket Upgrade (2.4.47 and later) ProxyPass "/some/ws/capable/path/" "http://example.com/some/ws/capable/path/" upgrade=websocket Access via Handler You can also force a request to be handled as a reverse-proxy
        request, by creating a suitable Handler pass-through. The example
        configuration below will pass all requests for PHP scripts to the
        specified FastCGI server using reverse proxy: Reverse Proxy PHP scripts <FilesMatch "\.php$">
    # Unix sockets require 2.4.7 or later
    SetHandler  "proxy:unix:/path/to/app.sock|fcgi://localhost/"
</FilesMatch> This feature is available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.10 and later. Workers The proxy manages the configuration of origin servers and their
      communication parameters in objects called workers .
      There are two built-in workers: the default forward proxy worker and the
      default reverse proxy worker. Additional workers can be configured
      explicitly. The two default workers have a fixed configuration
      and will be used if no other worker matches the request.
      They do not use HTTP Keep-Alive or connection reuse.
      The TCP connections to the origin server will instead be
      opened and closed for each request. Explicitly configured workers are identified by their URL.
      They are usually created and configured using ProxyPass or ProxyPassMatch when used
      for a reverse proxy: ProxyPass "/example" "http://backend.example.com" connectiontimeout=5 timeout=30 This will create a worker associated with the origin server URL http://backend.example.com that will use the given timeout
      values. When used in a forward proxy, workers are usually defined
      via the ProxySet directive: ProxySet "http://backend.example.com" connectiontimeout=5 timeout=30 or alternatively using Proxy and ProxySet : <Proxy "http://backend.example.com">
  ProxySet connectiontimeout=5 timeout=30
</Proxy> Using explicitly configured workers in the forward mode is
      not very common, because forward proxies usually communicate with many
      different origin servers. Creating explicit workers for some of the
      origin servers can still be useful if they are used very often.
      Explicitly configured workers have no concept of forward or reverse
      proxying by themselves. They encapsulate a common concept of
      communication with origin servers. A worker created by ProxyPass for use in a
      reverse proxy will also be used for forward proxy requests whenever
      the URL to the origin server matches the worker URL, and vice versa. The URL identifying a direct worker is the URL of its
      origin server including any path components given: ProxyPass "/examples" "http://backend.example.com/examples"
ProxyPass "/docs" "http://backend.example.com/docs" This example defines two different workers, each using a separate
      connection pool and configuration. Worker Sharing Worker sharing happens if the worker URLs overlap, which occurs when
        the URL of some worker is a leading substring of the URL of another
        worker defined later in the configuration file. In the following example ProxyPass "/apps" "http://backend.example.com/" timeout=60
ProxyPass "/examples" "http://backend.example.com/examples" timeout=10 the second worker isn't actually created. Instead the first
        worker is used. The benefit is, that there is only one connection pool,
        so connections are more often reused. Note that all configuration attributes
        given explicitly for the later worker will be ignored. This will be logged
        as a warning. In the above example, the resulting timeout value
        for the URL /examples will be 60 instead
        of 10 ! If you want to avoid worker sharing, sort your worker definitions
        by URL length, starting with the longest worker URLs. If you want to maximize
        worker sharing, use the reverse sort order. See also the related warning about
        ordering ProxyPass directives. Explicitly configured workers come in two flavors: direct workers and (load) balancer workers .
      They support many important configuration attributes which are
      described below in the ProxyPass directive. The same attributes can also be set using ProxySet . The set of options available for a direct worker
      depends on the protocol which is specified in the origin server URL.
      Available protocols include ajp , fcgi , ftp , http and scgi . Balancer workers are virtual workers that use direct workers known
      as their members to actually handle the requests. Each balancer can
      have multiple members. When it handles a request, it chooses a member
      based on the configured load balancing algorithm. A balancer worker is created if its worker URL uses balancer as the protocol scheme.
      The balancer URL uniquely identifies the balancer worker.
      Members are added to a balancer using BalancerMember . DNS resolution for origin domains DNS resolution happens when the socket to
        the origin domain is created for the first time.
        When connection reuse is enabled, each backend domain is resolved 
        only once per child process, and cached for all further connections 
        until the child is recycled. This information should to be considered 
        while planning DNS maintenance tasks involving backend domains. 
        Please also check ProxyPass parameters for more details about connection reuse. Controlling Access to Your Proxy You can control who can access your proxy via the <Proxy> control block as in
      the following example: <Proxy "*">
  Require ip 192.168.0
</Proxy> For more information on access control directives, see mod_authz_host . Strictly limiting access is essential if you are using a
      forward proxy (using the ProxyRequests directive).
      Otherwise, your server can be used by any client to access
      arbitrary hosts while hiding his or her true identity.  This is
      dangerous both for your network and for the Internet at large.
      When using a reverse proxy (using the ProxyPass directive with ProxyRequests Off ), access control is less
      critical because clients can only contact the hosts that you
      have specifically configured. See Also the Proxy-Chain-Auth environment variable. Slow Startup If you're using the ProxyBlock directive, hostnames' IP addresses are looked up
      and cached during startup for later match test. This may take a few
      seconds (or more) depending on the speed with which the hostname lookups
      occur. Intranet Proxy An Apache httpd proxy server situated in an intranet needs to forward
      external requests through the company's firewall (for this, configure
      the ProxyRemote directive
      to forward the respective scheme to the firewall proxy).
      However, when it has to
      access resources within the intranet, it can bypass the firewall when
      accessing hosts. The NoProxy directive is useful for specifying which hosts belong to the intranet and
      should be accessed directly. Users within an intranet tend to omit the local domain name from their
      WWW requests, thus requesting "http://somehost/" instead of http://somehost.example.com/ . Some commercial proxy servers
      let them get away with this and simply serve the request, implying a
      configured local domain. When the ProxyDomain directive is used and the server is configured for proxy service , Apache httpd can return
      a redirect response and send the client to the correct, fully qualified,
      server address. This is the preferred method since the user's bookmark
      files will then contain fully qualified hosts. Protocol Adjustments For circumstances where mod_proxy is sending
      requests to an origin server that doesn't properly implement
      keepalives or HTTP/1.1, there are two environment variables that can force the
      request to use HTTP/1.0 with no keepalive. These are set via the SetEnv directive. These are the force-proxy-request-1.0 and proxy-nokeepalive notes. <Location "/buggyappserver/">
  ProxyPass "http://buggyappserver:7001/foo/"
  SetEnv force-proxy-request-1.0 1
  SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1
</Location> In 2.4.26 and later, the "no-proxy" environment variable can be set to disable mod_proxy processing the current request.
      This variable should be set with SetEnvIf , as SetEnv is not evaluated early enough. Request Bodies Some request methods such as POST include a request body.
    The HTTP protocol requires that requests which include a body
    either use chunked transfer encoding or send a Content-Length request header.  When passing these
    requests on to the origin server, mod_proxy_http will always attempt to send the Content-Length .  But
    if the body is large and the original request used chunked
    encoding, then chunked encoding may also be used in the upstream
    request.  You can control this selection using environment variables .  Setting proxy-sendcl ensures maximum compatibility with
    upstream servers by always sending the Content-Length , while setting proxy-sendchunked minimizes resource usage by using
    chunked encoding. Under some circumstances, the server must spool request bodies
    to disk to satisfy the requested handling of request bodies.  For
    example, this spooling will occur if the original body was sent with
    chunked encoding (and is large), but the administrator has
    asked for backend requests to be sent with Content-Length or as HTTP/1.0.
    This spooling can also occur if the request body already has a
    Content-Length header, but the server is configured to filter incoming
    request bodies. Reverse Proxy Request Headers When acting in a reverse-proxy mode (using the ProxyPass directive, for example), mod_proxy_http adds several request headers in
    order to pass information to the origin server. These headers
    are: X-Forwarded-For The IP address of the client. X-Forwarded-Host The original host requested by the client in the Host HTTP request header. X-Forwarded-Server The hostname of the proxy server. Be careful when using these headers on the origin server, since
    they will contain more than one (comma-separated) value if the
    original request already contained one of these headers. For
    example, you can use %{X-Forwarded-For}i in the log
    format string of the origin server to log the original clients IP
    address, but you may get more than one address if the request
    passes through several proxies. See also the ProxyPreserveHost and ProxyVia directives, which control
    other request headers. Note:  If you need to specify custom request headers to be
    added to the forwarded request, use the RequestHeader directive. BalancerGrowth Directive Description: Number of additional Balancers that can be added Post-configuration Syntax: BalancerGrowth # Default: BalancerGrowth 5 Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: BalancerGrowth is only available in Apache HTTP Server 2.3.13
  and later. This directive allows for growth potential in the number of
    Balancers available for a virtualhost in addition to the
    number pre-configured. It only takes effect if there is at
    least one pre-configured Balancer. BalancerInherit Directive Description: Inherit ProxyPassed Balancers/Workers from the main server Syntax: BalancerInherit On|Off Default: BalancerInherit On Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: BalancerInherit is only available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.5 and later. This directive will cause the current server/vhost to "inherit" ProxyPass
            Balancers and Workers defined in the main server. This can cause issues and
            inconsistent behavior if using the Balancer Manager and so should be disabled
            if using that feature. The setting in the global server defines the default for all vhosts. BalancerMember Directive Description: Add a member to a load balancing group Syntax: BalancerMember [ balancerurl ] url [ key=value [key=value ...]] Context: directory Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: BalancerMember is only available in Apache HTTP Server 2.2
        and later. This directive adds a member to a load balancing group. It can be used
            within a <Proxy balancer:// ...> container
            directive and can take any of the key value pair parameters available to ProxyPass directives. One additional parameter is available only to BalancerMember directives: loadfactor . This is the member load factor - a decimal number between 1.0
            (default) and 100.0, which defines the weighted load to be applied to the
            member in question. The balancerurl is only needed when not within a <Proxy balancer:// ...> container directive. It corresponds to the url of a balancer defined in ProxyPass directive. The path component of the balancer URL in any <Proxy balancer:// ...> container directive
            is ignored. Trailing slashes should typically be removed from the URL of a BalancerMember . BalancerPersist Directive Description: Attempt to persist changes made by the Balancer Manager across restarts. Syntax: BalancerPersist On|Off Default: BalancerPersist Off Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: BalancerPersist is only available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.4 and later. This directive will cause the shared memory storage associated
        with the balancers and balancer members to be persisted across
        restarts. This allows these local changes to not be lost during the
        normal restart/graceful state transitions. NoProxy Directive Description: Hosts, domains, or networks that will be connected to
directly Syntax: NoProxy host [ host ] ... Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy This directive is only useful for Apache httpd proxy servers within
    intranets.  The NoProxy directive specifies a
    list of subnets, IP addresses, hosts and/or domains, separated by
    spaces. A request to a host which matches one or more of these is
    always served directly, without forwarding to the configured ProxyRemote proxy server(s). Example ProxyRemote  "*"  "http://firewall.example.com:81"
NoProxy         ".example.com" "192.168.112.0/21" The host arguments to the NoProxy directive are one of the following type list: Domain A Domain is a partially qualified DNS domain name, preceded
    by a period. It represents a list of hosts which logically belong to the
    same DNS domain or zone ( i.e. , the suffixes of the hostnames are
    all ending in Domain ). Examples .com .example.org. To distinguish Domain s from Hostname s (both syntactically and semantically; a DNS domain can
    have a DNS A record, too!), Domain s are always written with a
    leading period. Note Domain name comparisons are done without regard to the case, and Domain s are always assumed to be anchored in the root of the
      DNS tree; therefore, the two domains .ExAmple.com and .example.com. (note the trailing period) are considered
      equal. Since a domain comparison does not involve a DNS lookup, it is much
      more efficient than subnet comparison. SubNet A SubNet is a partially qualified internet address in
    numeric (dotted quad) form, optionally followed by a slash and the netmask,
    specified as the number of significant bits in the SubNet . It is
    used to represent a subnet of hosts which can be reached over a common
    network interface. In the absence of the explicit net mask it is assumed
    that omitted (or zero valued) trailing digits specify the mask. (In this
    case, the netmask can only be multiples of 8 bits wide.) Examples: 192.168 or 192.168.0.0 the subnet 192.168.0.0 with an implied netmask of 16 valid bits
    (sometimes used in the netmask form 255.255.0.0 ) 192.168.112.0/21 the subnet 192.168.112.0/21 with a netmask of 21
    valid bits (also used in the form 255.255.248.0 ) As a degenerate case, a SubNet with 32 valid bits is the
    equivalent to an IPAddr , while a SubNet with zero
    valid bits ( e.g. , 0.0.0.0/0) is the same as the constant _Default_ , matching any IP address. IPAddr A IPAddr represents a fully qualified internet address in
    numeric (dotted quad) form. Usually, this address represents a host, but
    there need not necessarily be a DNS domain name connected with the
    address. Example 192.168.123.7 Note An IPAddr does not need to be resolved by the DNS system, so
      it can result in more effective apache performance. Hostname A Hostname is a fully qualified DNS domain name which can
    be resolved to one or more IPAddrs via the
    DNS domain name service. It represents a logical host (in contrast to Domain s, see above) and must be resolvable
    to at least one IPAddr (or often to a list
    of hosts with different IPAddr s). Examples prep.ai.example.edu www.example.org Note In many situations, it is more effective to specify an IPAddr in place of a Hostname since a
      DNS lookup can be avoided. Name resolution in Apache httpd can take a remarkable
      deal of time when the connection to the name server uses a slow PPP
      link. Hostname comparisons are done without regard to the case,
      and Hostname s are always assumed to be anchored in the root
      of the DNS tree; therefore, the two hosts WWW.ExAmple.com and www.example.com. (note the trailing period) are
      considered equal. See also DNS Issues <Proxy> Directive Description: Container for directives applied to proxied resources Syntax: <Proxy wildcard-url > ...</Proxy> Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Directives placed in <Proxy> sections apply only to matching proxied content.  Shell-style wildcards are
    allowed. For example, the following will allow only hosts in yournetwork.example.com to access content via your proxy
    server: <Proxy "*">
  Require host yournetwork.example.com
</Proxy> The following example will process all files in the foo directory of example.com through the INCLUDES filter when they are sent through the proxy server: <Proxy "http://example.com/foo/*">
  SetOutputFilter INCLUDES
</Proxy> Differences from the Location configuration section A backend URL matches the configuration section if it begins with the
      the wildcard-url string, even if the last path segment in the
      directive only matches a prefix of the backend URL.  For example,
      <Proxy "http://example.com/foo"> matches all of
      http://example.com/foo, http://example.com/foo/bar, and
      http://example.com/foobar.  The matching of the final URL differs
      from the behavior of the <Location> section, which for purposes of this note
      treats the final path component as if it ended in a slash. For more control over the matching, see <ProxyMatch> . See also <ProxyMatch> Proxy100Continue Directive Description: Forward 100-continue expectation to the origin server Syntax: Proxy100Continue Off|On Default: Proxy100Continue On Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: Available in version 2.4.40 and later This directive determines whether the proxy should forward 100-continue Expect: ation to the origin server and thus let it decide when/if
    the HTTP request body should be read, or when Off the proxy
    should generate 100 Continue intermediate response by itself before
    forwarding the request body. Effectiveness This option is of use only for HTTP proxying, as handled by mod_proxy_http . ProxyAddHeaders Directive Description: Add proxy information in X-Forwarded-* headers Syntax: ProxyAddHeaders Off|On Default: ProxyAddHeaders On Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: Available in version 2.3.10 and later This directive determines whether or not proxy related information should be passed to the
    backend server through X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Server HTTP headers. Effectiveness This option is of use only for HTTP proxying, as handled by mod_proxy_http . ProxyBadHeader Directive Description: Determines how to handle bad header lines in a
response Syntax: ProxyBadHeader IsError|Ignore|StartBody Default: ProxyBadHeader IsError Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy The ProxyBadHeader directive determines the
    behavior of mod_proxy if it receives syntactically invalid
    response header lines ( i.e. containing no colon) from the origin
    server. The following arguments are possible: IsError Abort the request and end up with a 502 (Bad Gateway) response. This is
    the default behavior. Ignore Treat bad header lines as if they weren't sent. StartBody When receiving the first bad header line, finish reading the headers and
    treat the remainder as body. This helps to work around buggy backend servers
    which forget to insert an empty line between the headers and the body. ProxyBlock Directive Description: Words, hosts, or domains that are banned from being
proxied Syntax: ProxyBlock *| word | host | domain [ word | host | domain ] ... Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy The ProxyBlock directive specifies a list of
    words, hosts and/or domains, separated by spaces.  HTTP, HTTPS, and
    FTP document requests to sites whose names contain matched words,
    hosts or domains are blocked by the proxy server. The proxy
    module will also attempt to determine IP addresses of list items which
    may be hostnames during startup, and cache them for match test as
    well. That may slow down the startup time of the server. Example ProxyBlock "news.example.com" "auctions.example.com" "friends.example.com" Note that example would also be sufficient to match any
    of these sites. Hosts would also be matched if referenced by IP address. Note also that ProxyBlock "*" blocks connections to all sites. ProxyDomain Directive Description: Default domain name for proxied requests Syntax: ProxyDomain Domain Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy This directive is only useful for Apache httpd proxy servers within
    intranets. The ProxyDomain directive specifies
    the default domain which the apache proxy server will belong to. If a
    request to a host without a domain name is encountered, a redirection
    response to the same host with the configured Domain appended
    will be generated. Example ProxyRemote  "*"  "http://firewall.example.com:81"
NoProxy         ".example.com" "192.168.112.0/21"
ProxyDomain     ".example.com" ProxyErrorOverride Directive Description: Override error pages for proxied content Syntax: ProxyErrorOverride Off|On [ code ...] Default: ProxyErrorOverride Off Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: The list of status codes was added in 2.4.47 This directive is useful for reverse-proxy setups where you want to
    have a common look and feel on the error pages seen by the end user.
    This also allows for included files (via mod_include 's SSI) to get
    the error code and act accordingly. (Default behavior would display
    the error page of the proxied server. Turning this on shows the SSI
    Error message.) This directive does not affect the processing of informational (1xx),
    normal success (2xx), or redirect (3xx) responses. By default ProxyErrorOverride affects all responses with codes between 400 (including)
        and 600 (excluding). Example for default behavior ProxyErrorOverride  On To change the default behavior, you can specify the status codes to consider, separated by spaces.
        If you do so, all other status codes will be ignored.
        You can only specify status codes, that are considered error codes: between 400 (including)
        and 600 (excluding). Example for custom status codes ProxyErrorOverride  On 403 405 500 501 502 503 504 ProxyIOBufferSize Directive Description: Determine size of internal data throughput buffer Syntax: ProxyIOBufferSize bytes Default: ProxyIOBufferSize 8192 Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy The ProxyIOBufferSize directive adjusts the size
    of the internal buffer which is used as a scratchpad for the data between
    input and output. The size must be at least 512 . In almost every case, there's no reason to change that value. If used with AJP, this directive sets the maximum AJP packet size in
    bytes. Values larger than 65536 are set to 65536. If you change it from
    the default, you must also change the packetSize attribute of
    your AJP connector on the Tomcat side! The attribute packetSize is only available in Tomcat 5.5.20+ and 6.0.2+ Normally it is not necessary to change the maximum packet size.
    Problems with the default value have been reported when sending
    certificates or certificate chains. <ProxyMatch> Directive Description: Container for directives applied to regular-expression-matched
proxied resources Syntax: <ProxyMatch regex > ...</ProxyMatch> Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy The <ProxyMatch> directive is
    identical to the <Proxy> directive, except that it matches URLs
    using regular expressions . From 2.4.8 onwards, named groups and backreferences are captured and
    written to the environment with the corresponding name prefixed with
    "MATCH_" and in upper case. This allows elements of URLs to be referenced
    from within expressions and modules like mod_rewrite . In order to prevent confusion, numbered
    (unnamed) backreferences are ignored. Use named groups instead. <ProxyMatch "^http://(?<sitename>[^/]+)">
    Require ldap-group cn=%{env:MATCH_SITENAME},ou=combined,o=Example
</ProxyMatch> See also <Proxy> ProxyMaxForwards Directive Description: Maximum number of proxies that a request can be forwarded
through Syntax: ProxyMaxForwards number Default: ProxyMaxForwards -1 Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: Default behaviour changed in 2.2.7 The ProxyMaxForwards directive specifies the
    maximum number of proxies through which a request may pass if there's no Max-Forwards header supplied with the request. This may
    be set to prevent infinite proxy loops or a DoS attack. Example ProxyMaxForwards 15 Note that setting ProxyMaxForwards is a
    violation of the HTTP/1.1 protocol (RFC2616), which forbids a Proxy
    setting Max-Forwards if the Client didn't set it.
    Earlier Apache httpd versions would always set it.  A negative ProxyMaxForwards value, including the
    default -1, gives you protocol-compliant behavior but may
    leave you open to loops. ProxyPass Directive Description: Maps remote servers into the local server URL-space Syntax: ProxyPass [ path ] !| url [ key=value [key=value ...]] [nocanon] [interpolate] [noquery] Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: Unix Domain Socket (UDS) support added in 2.4.7 This directive allows remote servers to be mapped into the
    space of the local server. The local server does not act as a
    proxy in the conventional sense but appears to be a mirror of the
    remote server. The local server is often called a reverse
    proxy or gateway . The path is the name of
    a local virtual path; url is a partial URL for the
    remote server and cannot include a query string. It is strongly suggested to review the concept of a Worker before proceeding any further
    with this section. This directive is not supported within <Directory> , <If> and <Files> containers. The ProxyRequests directive should
    usually be set off when using ProxyPass . In 2.4.7 and later, support for using a Unix Domain Socket is available by using a target
    which prepends unix:/path/lis.sock| . For example, to proxy
    HTTP and target the UDS at /home/www.socket, you would use unix:/home/www.socket|http://localhost/whatever/ . Note: The path associated with the unix: URL is DefaultRuntimeDir aware. When used inside a <Location> section, the first argument is omitted and the local
    directory is obtained from the <Location> . The same will occur inside a <LocationMatch> section;
    however, ProxyPass does not interpret the regexp as such, so it is necessary
    to use ProxyPassMatch in this situation instead. Suppose the local server has address http://example.com/ ;
    then <Location "/mirror/foo/">
    ProxyPass "http://backend.example.com/"
</Location> will cause a local request for http://example.com/mirror/foo/bar to be internally converted
    into a proxy request to http://backend.example.com/bar . If you require a more flexible reverse-proxy configuration, see the RewriteRule directive with the [P] flag. The following alternative syntax is possible; however, it can carry a
    performance penalty when present in very large numbers. The advantage of
    the below syntax is that it allows for dynamic control via the Balancer Manager interface: ProxyPass "/mirror/foo/" "http://backend.example.com/" If the first argument ends with a trailing / , the second
       argument should also end with a trailing / , and vice
       versa. Otherwise, the resulting requests to the backend may miss some
       needed slashes and do not deliver the expected results. The ! directive is useful in situations where you don't want
    to reverse-proxy a subdirectory, e.g. <Location "/mirror/foo/">
    ProxyPass "http://backend.example.com/"
</Location>
<Location "/mirror/foo/i">
    ProxyPass "!"
</Location> ProxyPass "/mirror/foo/i" "!"
ProxyPass "/mirror/foo" "http://backend.example.com" will proxy all requests to /mirror/foo to backend.example.com except requests made to /mirror/foo/i . Mixing ProxyPass settings in different contexts does not work: ProxyPass "/mirror/foo/i" "!"
<Location "/mirror/foo/">
    ProxyPass "http://backend.example.com/"
</Location> In this case, a request to /mirror/foo/i will get proxied,
       because the ProxyPass directive in the Location block will be evaluated
       first. The fact that ProxyPass supports both server and directory contexts
       does not mean that their scope and position in the configuration file will
       guarantee any ordering or override. Ordering ProxyPass Directives The configured ProxyPass and ProxyPassMatch rules are checked in the order of configuration. The first rule that
      matches wins. So usually you should sort conflicting ProxyPass rules starting with the
      longest URLs first. Otherwise, later rules for longer URLS will be hidden
      by any earlier rule which uses a leading substring of the URL. Note that
      there is some relation with worker sharing. Ordering ProxyPass Directives in Locations Only one ProxyPass directive
      can be placed in a Location block,
      and the most specific location will take precedence. Exclusions and the no-proxy environment variable Exclusions must come before the
      general ProxyPass directives. In 2.4.26 and later, the "no-proxy"
      environment variable is an alternative to exclusions, and is the only
      way to configure an exclusion of a ProxyPass directive in Location context. 
      This variable should be set with SetEnvIf , as SetEnv is not evaluated early enough. ProxyPass key=value Parameters In Apache HTTP Server 2.1 and later, mod_proxy supports pooled
    connections to a backend server.  Connections created on demand
    can be retained in a pool for future use.  Limits on the pool size
    and other settings can be coded on
    the ProxyPass directive
    using key=value parameters, described in the tables
    below. Maximum connections to the backend By default, mod_proxy will allow and retain the maximum number of
    connections that could be used simultaneously by that web server child
    process.  Use the max parameter to reduce the number from
    the default. The pool of connections is maintained per web server child
    process, and max and other settings are not coordinated
    among all child processes, except when only one child process is allowed
    by configuration or MPM design. Use the ttl parameter to set an optional
    time to live; connections which have been unused for at least ttl seconds will be closed. ttl can be used
    to avoid using a connection which is subject to closing because of the
    backend server's keep-alive timeout. Example ProxyPass "/example" "http://backend.example.com" max=20 ttl=120 retry=300 Worker|BalancerMember parameters Parameter Default Description min 0 Minimum number of connection pool entries, unrelated to the
    actual number of connections.  This only needs to be modified from the
    default for special circumstances where heap memory associated with the
    backend connections should be preallocated or retained. max 1...n Maximum number of connections that will be allowed to the
    backend server. The default for this limit is the number of threads
    per process in the active MPM. In the Prefork MPM, this is always 1,
    while with other MPMs, it is controlled by the ThreadsPerChild directive. smax max Retained connection pool entries above this limit are freed
    during certain operations if they have been unused for longer than
    the time to live, controlled by the ttl parameter.  If
    the connection pool entry has an associated connection, it will be
    closed.  This only needs to be modified from the default for special
    circumstances where connection pool entries and any associated
    connections which have exceeded the time to live need to be freed or
    closed more aggressively. acquire - If set, this will be the maximum time to wait for a free
    connection in the connection pool, in milliseconds. If there are no free
    connections in the pool, the Apache httpd will return SERVER_BUSY status to the client. connectiontimeout timeout Connect timeout in seconds.
        The number of seconds Apache httpd waits for the creation of a connection to
        the backend to complete. By adding a postfix of ms, the timeout can be
        also set in milliseconds. disablereuse Off This parameter should be used when you want to force mod_proxy
    to immediately close a connection to the backend after being used, and
    thus, disable its persistent connection and pool for that backend.
    This helps in various situations where a firewall between Apache
    httpd and
    the backend server (regardless of protocol) tends to silently
    drop connections or when backends themselves may be under round-
    robin DNS.
    When connection reuse is enabled each backend domain is resolved
    (with a DNS query) only once per child process and cached for all further
    connections until the child is recycled. To disable connection reuse,
    set this property value to On . enablereuse On This is the inverse of 'disablereuse' above, provided as a
        convenience for scheme handlers that require opt-in for connection
        reuse (such as mod_proxy_fcgi ).  2.4.11 and later only. flushpackets off Determines whether the proxy module will auto-flush the output
        brigade after each "chunk" of data. 'off' means that it will flush
        only when needed; 'on' means after each chunk is sent; and
        'auto' means poll/wait for a period of time and flush if
        no input has been received for 'flushwait' milliseconds.
        Currently, this is in effect only for mod_proxy_ajp and mod_proxy_fcgi. flushwait 10 The time to wait for additional input, in milliseconds, before
        flushing the output brigade if 'flushpackets' is 'auto'. iobuffersize 8192 Adjusts the size of the internal scratchpad IO buffer. This allows you
        to override the ProxyIOBufferSize for a specific worker.
        This must be at least 512 or set to 0 for the system default of 8192. responsefieldsize 8192 Adjust the size of the proxy response field buffer. The buffer size
            should be at least the size of the largest expected header size from
            a proxied response. Setting the value to 0 will use the system
            default of 8192 bytes. Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.34 and later. keepalive Off This parameter should be used when you have a firewall between your
    Apache httpd and the backend server, which tends to drop inactive connections.
    This flag will tell the Operating System to send KEEP_ALIVE messages on inactive connections and thus prevent the firewall from dropping
    the connection.
    To enable keepalive, set this property value to On . The frequency of initial and subsequent TCP keepalive probes
    depends on global OS settings, and may be as high as 2 hours. To be useful,
    the frequency configured in the OS must be smaller than the threshold used
    by the firewall. lbset 0 Sets the load balancer cluster set that the worker is a member
         of. The load balancer will try all members of a lower numbered
         lbset before trying higher numbered ones. ping 0 Ping property tells the webserver to "test" the connection to
        the backend before forwarding the request. For AJP, it causes mod_proxy_ajp to send a CPING request on the ajp13 connection (implemented on Tomcat 3.3.2+, 4.1.28+
        and 5.0.13+). For HTTP, it causes mod_proxy_http to send a 100-Continue to the backend (only valid for
        HTTP/1.1 - for non HTTP/1.1 backends, this property has no
        effect). In both cases, the parameter is the delay in seconds to wait
        for the reply.
        This feature has been added to avoid problems with hung and
        busy backends.
        This will increase the network traffic during the normal operation
        which could be an issue, but it will lower the
        traffic in case some of the cluster nodes are down or busy.
        By adding a postfix of ms, the delay can be also set in
        milliseconds. receivebuffersize 0 Adjusts the size of the explicit (TCP/IP) network buffer size for
        proxied connections. This allows you to override the ProxyReceiveBufferSize for a specific worker.
        This must be at least 512 or set to 0 for the system default. redirect - Redirection Route of the worker. This value is usually
        set dynamically to enable safe removal of the node from
        the cluster. If set, all requests without session id will be
        redirected to the BalancerMember that has route parameter
        equal to this value. retry 60 Connection pool worker retry timeout in seconds.
    If the connection pool worker to the backend server is in the error state,
    Apache httpd will not forward any requests to that server until the timeout
    expires. This enables to shut down the backend server for maintenance
    and bring it back online later. A value of 0 means always retry workers
    in an error state with no timeout. route - Route of the worker when used inside load balancer.
        The route is a value appended to session id. status - Single letter value defining the initial status of
        this worker. D: Worker is disabled and will not accept any requests. S: Worker is administratively stopped. I: Worker is in ignore-errors mode and will always be considered available. R: Worker is a hot spare. For each worker in a given lbset that is unusable
                    (draining, stopped, in error, etc.), a usable hot spare with the same lbset will be used in
                    its place. Hot spares can help ensure that a specific number of workers are always available
                    for use by a balancer. H: Worker is in hot-standby mode and will only be used if no other
                    viable workers or spares are available in the balancer set. E: Worker is in an error state. N: Worker is in drain mode and will only accept existing sticky sessions
                    destined for itself and ignore all other requests. Status
        can be set (which is the default) by prepending with '+' or
        cleared by prepending with '-'.
        Thus, a setting of 'S-E' sets this worker to Stopped and
        clears the in-error flag. timeout ProxyTimeout Socket timeout in seconds.
        The number of seconds Apache httpd waits for data sent by / to the backend. ttl - Time to live for inactive connections and associated connection
        pool entries, in seconds.  Once reaching this limit, a
        connection will not be used again; it will be closed at some
        later time. flusher flush Name of the provider used by mod_proxy_fdpass .
        See the documentation of this module for more details. secret - Value of secret used by mod_proxy_ajp .
        It must be identical to the secret configured on the server side of the
        AJP connection. Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.42 and later. upgrade - Protocol accepted by mod_proxy_http or mod_proxy_wstunnel for the HTTP Upgrade mechanism
        upon negotiation by the HTTP client/browser (per RFC 9110 - Upgrade ).
        See the Protocol Upgrade note below mapping - Type of mapping between the path and the url .
        This determines the normalization and/or (non-)decoding that mod_proxy will apply to the requested uri-path before matching the path . If
        a mapping matches, it's committed to the uri-path such that all the directory
        contexts that use a path (like <Location> ) will be matched using the
        same mapping. mapping=encoded prevents the %-decoding of the uri-path so
        that one can use for instance configurations like: ProxyPass "/special%3Fsegment" "https://example.com/special%3Fsegment" mapping=encoded <Location "/special%3Fsegment">
  Require ip 172.17.2.0/24
</Location> mapping=servlet refers to the normalization defined by the Servlet
        specification, which is for instance applied by Apache Tomcat for servlet containers
        (notably the path parameters are ignored for the mapping). An uri-path like /some;foo/path is then mapped as /some/path hence matches any
        of the below regardless of the requested path parameters: ProxyPass "/some/path" "https://servlet.example.com/some/path" mapping=servlet <Location "/some/path">
  Require valid-user
</Location> Note It is recommended to use the same mapping on the Apache httpd side than the one
            used on the backend side. For instance when configuring authorizations in <Location> blocks for paths that are mapped by mod_proxy to some servlet containers (like applications running on Apache Tomcat), one should
            use the mapping=servlet setting to prevent path parameters and alike from
            interfering with the authorizations that are to be enforced in by the Apache httpd. addressttl -1 TTL in seconds for how long DNS resolutions of the backend address are cached.
        -1 means until restart of Apache httpd. If the Proxy directive scheme starts with the balancer:// (eg: balancer://cluster ,
    any path information is ignored), then a virtual worker that does not really
    communicate with the backend server will be created. Instead, it is responsible
    for the management of several "real" workers. In that case, the special set of
    parameters can be added to this virtual worker. 
    See mod_proxy_balancer for more information about how 
    the balancer works. Balancer parameters Parameter Default Description lbmethod byrequests Balancer load-balance method. Select the load-balancing scheduler
        method to use. Either byrequests , to perform weighted
        request counting; bytraffic , to perform weighted
        traffic byte count balancing; or bybusyness , to perform
        pending request balancing. The default is byrequests . maxattempts One less than the number of workers, or 1 with a single worker. Maximum number of failover attempts before giving up. nofailover Off If set to On , the session will break if the worker is in
        error state or disabled. Set this value to On if backend
        servers do not support session replication. stickysession - Balancer sticky session name. The value is usually set to something
        like JSESSIONID or PHPSESSIONID ,
        and it depends on the backend application server that support sessions.
        If the backend application server uses different name for cookies
        and url encoded id (like servlet containers) use | to separate them.
        The first part is for the cookie the second for the path. Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.4 and later. stickysessionsep "." Sets the separation symbol in the session cookie. Some backend application servers
        do not use the '.' as the symbol. For example, the Oracle Weblogic server uses
        '!'. The correct symbol can be set using this option. The setting of 'Off'
        signifies that no symbol is used. scolonpathdelim Off If set to On , the semi-colon character ';' will be
        used as an additional sticky session path delimiter/separator. This
        is mainly used to emulate mod_jk's behavior when dealing with paths such
        as JSESSIONID=6736bcf34;foo=aabfa timeout 0 Balancer timeout in seconds. If set, this will be the maximum time
        to wait for a free worker. The default is to not wait. failonstatus - A single or comma-separated list of HTTP status codes. If set, this will
        force the worker into error state when the backend returns any status code
        in the list. Worker recovery behaves the same as other worker errors. failontimeout Off If set, an IO read timeout after a request is sent to the backend will
        force the worker into error state. Worker recovery behaves the same as other
        worker errors. Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.5 and later. nonce <auto> The protective nonce used in the balancer-manager application page.
        The default is to use an automatically determined UUID-based
        nonce, to provide for further protection for the page. If set,
        then the nonce is set to that value. A setting of None disables all nonce checking. Note In addition to the nonce, the balancer-manager page
      should be protected via an ACL. growth 0 Number of additional BalancerMembers to allow to be added
        to this balancer in addition to those defined at configuration. forcerecovery On Force the immediate recovery of all workers without considering the
        retry parameter of the workers if all workers of a balancer are
        in error state. There might be cases where an already overloaded backend
        can get into deeper trouble if the recovery of all workers is enforced
        without considering the retry parameter of each worker. In this case,
        set to Off . Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.2 and later. A sample balancer setup: ProxyPass "/special-area" "http://special.example.com" smax=5 max=10
ProxyPass "/" "balancer://mycluster/" stickysession=JSESSIONID|jsessionid nofailover=On
<Proxy "balancer://mycluster">
    BalancerMember "ajp://1.2.3.4:8009"
    BalancerMember "ajp://1.2.3.5:8009" loadfactor=20
    # Less powerful server, don't send as many requests there,
    BalancerMember "ajp://1.2.3.6:8009" loadfactor=5
</Proxy> Configuring hot spares can help ensure that a certain number of
    workers are always available for use per load balancer set: ProxyPass "/" "balancer://sparecluster/"
<Proxy balancer://sparecluster>
    BalancerMember ajp://1.2.3.4:8009
    BalancerMember ajp://1.2.3.5:8009
    # The servers below are hot spares. For each server above that is unusable
    # (draining, stopped, unreachable, in error state, etc.), one of these spares
    # will be used in its place. Two servers will always be available for a request
    # unless one or more of the spares is also unusable.
    BalancerMember ajp://1.2.3.6:8009 status=+R
    BalancerMember ajp://1.2.3.7:8009 status=+R
</Proxy> Setting up a hot-standby that will only be used if no other
    members (or spares) are available in the load balancer set: ProxyPass "/" "balancer://hotcluster/"
<Proxy "balancer://hotcluster">
    BalancerMember "ajp://1.2.3.4:8009" loadfactor=1
    BalancerMember "ajp://1.2.3.5:8009" loadfactor=2.25
    # The server below is on hot standby
    BalancerMember "ajp://1.2.3.6:8009" status=+H
    ProxySet lbmethod=bytraffic
</Proxy> Additional ProxyPass Keywords Normally, mod_proxy will canonicalise ProxyPassed URLs.
    But this may be incompatible with some backends, particularly those
    that make use of PATH_INFO .  The optional nocanon keyword suppresses this and passes the URL path "raw" to the
    backend.  Note that this keyword may affect the security of your backend,
    as it removes the normal limited protection against URL-based attacks
    provided by the proxy. Normally, mod_proxy will include the query string when
    generating the SCRIPT_FILENAME environment variable.
    The optional noquery keyword (available in
    httpd 2.4.1 and later) prevents this. The optional interpolate keyword, in combination with ProxyPassInterpolateEnv , causes the ProxyPass
    to interpolate environment variables, using the syntax ${VARNAME} .  Note that many of the standard CGI-derived
    environment variables will not exist when this interpolation happens,
    so you may still have to resort to mod_rewrite for complex rules. Also note that interpolation is supported
    within the scheme/hostname/port portion of a URL only for variables that
    are available when the directive is parsed 
    (like Define ). Dynamic determination of
    those fields can be accomplished with mod_rewrite .
    The following example describes how to use mod_rewrite to dynamically set the scheme to http or https: RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond "%{HTTPS}" =off
RewriteRule "." "-" [E=protocol:http]
RewriteCond "%{HTTPS}" =on
RewriteRule "." "-" [E=protocol:https]

RewriteRule "^/mirror/foo/(.*)" "%{ENV:protocol}://backend.example.com/$1" [P]
ProxyPassReverse  "/mirror/foo/" "http://backend.example.com/"
ProxyPassReverse  "/mirror/foo/" "https://backend.example.com/" Protocol Upgrade Since Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47, protocol Upgrade (tunneling) can be handled
      end-to-end by mod_proxy_http using the ProxyPass parameter upgrade . End-to-end means that the HTTP Upgrade request from the client/browser is first
      forwarded by mod_proxy_http to the origin server and the connection
      will be upgraded (and tunneled by mod_proxy_http ) only if the origin
      server accepts/initiates the upgrade (HTTP response 101 Switching Protocols ).
      If the origin server responds with anything else mod_proxy_http will continue forwarding (and enforcing) the HTTP protocol as usual for this
      connection. See Websocket Upgrade (2.4.47 and later) for an example of
      configuration using mod_proxy_http . For Apache HTTP Server 2.4.46 and earlier (or if ProxyWebsocketFallbackToProxyHttp from 2.4.48 and later disables mod_proxy_http handling), see the
      documentation of mod_proxy_wstunnel for how to proxy the WebSocket
      protocol. ProxyPassInherit Directive Description: Inherit ProxyPass directives defined from the main server Syntax: ProxyPassInherit On|Off Default: ProxyPassInherit On Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: ProxyPassInherit is only available in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.5 and later. This directive will cause the current server/vhost to "inherit" ProxyPass directives defined in the main server. This can cause issues and
            inconsistent behavior if using the Balancer Manager for dynamic changes
            and so should be disabled if using that feature. The setting in the global server defines the default for all vhosts. Disabling ProxyPassInherit also disables BalancerInherit . ProxyPassInterpolateEnv Directive Description: Enable Environment Variable interpolation in Reverse Proxy configurations Syntax: ProxyPassInterpolateEnv On|Off Default: ProxyPassInterpolateEnv Off Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: Available in httpd 2.2.9 and later This directive, together with the interpolate argument to ProxyPass , ProxyPassReverse , ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain , and ProxyPassReverseCookiePath ,
    enables reverse proxies to be dynamically
    configured using environment variables which may be set by
    another module such as mod_rewrite .
    It affects the ProxyPass , ProxyPassReverse , ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain , and ProxyPassReverseCookiePath directives
    and causes them to substitute the value of an environment
    variable varname for the string ${varname} in configuration directives if the interpolate option is set. The scheme/hostname/port portion of ProxyPass may
    contain variables, but only the ones available when the directive is parsed
    (for example, using Define ).
    For all the other use cases, please consider using mod_rewrite instead. Performance warning Keep this turned off unless you need it!
    Adding variables to ProxyPass for example may lead to
    the use of the default mod_proxy's workers configured (that don't allow any fine
    tuning like connections reuse, etc..). ProxyPassMatch Directive Description: Maps remote servers into the local server URL-space using regular expressions Syntax: ProxyPassMatch [ regex ] !| url [ key=value [key=value ...]] Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: Since 2.4.47 the key=value Parameters are honored
when the url parameter contains backreference(s) (see note below). This directive is equivalent to ProxyPass but makes use of regular expressions instead of simple prefix matching. The
       supplied regular expression is matched against the url , and if it
       matches, the server will substitute any parenthesized matches into the given
       string and use it as a new url . Note: This directive cannot be used within a <Directory> context. Suppose the local server has address http://example.com/ ;
    then ProxyPassMatch "^/(.*\.gif)$" "http://backend.example.com/$1" will cause a local request for http://example.com/foo/bar.gif to be internally converted
    into a proxy request to http://backend.example.com/foo/bar.gif . The ! directive is useful in situations where you don't want
    to reverse-proxy a subdirectory. When used inside a <LocationMatch> section, the first argument is omitted and the
    regexp is obtained from the <LocationMatch> . If you require a more flexible reverse-proxy configuration, see the RewriteRule directive with the [P] flag. Default Substitution When the URL parameter doesn't use any backreferences into the regular
      expression, the original URL will be appended to the URL parameter. key=value Parameters versus url with backreference(s) Since Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47, the key=value Parameters
      are no longer ignored in a ProxyPassMatch using
      an url with backreference(s). However to keep the existing
      behavior regarding reuse/keepalive of backend connections (which were
      never reused before for these URLs), the parameter enablereuse (or disablereuse ) default to off (resp. on )
      in this case. Setting enablereuse=on explicitely allows to
      reuse connections unless some backreference(s) belong in
      the authority part (hostname and/or port) of the url (this condition is enforced since Apache HTTP Server 2.4.55, and produces
      a warning at startup because these URLs are not reusable per se). Security Warning Take care when constructing the target URL of the rule, considering
        the security impact from allowing the client influence over the set of
        URLs to which your server will act as a proxy.  Ensure that the scheme
        and hostname part of the URL is either fixed or does not allow the
        client undue influence. ProxyPassReverse Directive Description: Adjusts the URL in HTTP response headers sent from a reverse
proxied server Syntax: ProxyPassReverse [ path ] url [interpolate] Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy This directive lets Apache httpd adjust the URL in the Location , Content-Location and URI headers on HTTP
    redirect responses. This is essential when Apache httpd is used as a
    reverse proxy (or gateway) to avoid bypassing the reverse proxy
    because of HTTP redirects on the backend servers which stay behind
    the reverse proxy. Only the HTTP response headers specifically mentioned above
    will be rewritten. Apache httpd will not rewrite other response
    headers, nor will it by default rewrite URL references inside HTML pages.
    This means that if the proxied content contains absolute URL
    references, they will bypass the proxy. To rewrite HTML content to
    match the proxy, you must load and enable mod_proxy_html . path is the name of a local virtual path; url is a
    partial URL for the remote server. 
    These parameters are used the same way as for the ProxyPass directive. For example, suppose the local server has address http://example.com/ ; then ProxyPass         "/mirror/foo/" "http://backend.example.com/"
ProxyPassReverse  "/mirror/foo/" "http://backend.example.com/"
ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain  "backend.example.com"  "public.example.com"
ProxyPassReverseCookiePath  "/"  "/mirror/foo/" will not only cause a local request for the http://example.com/mirror/foo/bar to be internally converted
    into a proxy request to http://backend.example.com/bar (the functionality which ProxyPass provides here).
    It also takes care of redirects which the server backend.example.com sends when redirecting http://backend.example.com/bar to http://backend.example.com/quux . Apache httpd adjusts this to http://example.com/mirror/foo/quux before forwarding the HTTP
    redirect response to the client. Note that the hostname used for
    constructing the URL is chosen in respect to the setting of the UseCanonicalName directive. Note that this ProxyPassReverse directive can
    also be used in conjunction with the proxy feature
    ( RewriteRule ...  [P] ) from mod_rewrite because it doesn't depend on a corresponding ProxyPass directive. The optional interpolate keyword, used together with ProxyPassInterpolateEnv , enables interpolation
    of environment variables specified using the format ${VARNAME} .
    Note that interpolation is not supported within the scheme portion of a
    URL. When used inside a <Location> section, the first argument is omitted and the local
    directory is obtained from the <Location> . The same occurs inside a <LocationMatch> section, but will probably not work as
    intended, as ProxyPassReverse will interpret the regexp literally as a
    path; if needed in this situation, specify the ProxyPassReverse outside
    the section or in a separate <Location> section. This directive is not supported in <Directory> or <Files> sections. ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain Directive Description: Adjusts the Domain string in Set-Cookie headers from a reverse-
proxied server Syntax: ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain internal-domain public-domain [interpolate] Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Usage is basically similar to ProxyPassReverse , but instead of
rewriting headers that are a URL, this rewrites the domain string in Set-Cookie headers. ProxyPassReverseCookiePath Directive Description: Adjusts the Path string in Set-Cookie headers from a reverse-
proxied server Syntax: ProxyPassReverseCookiePath internal-path public-path [interpolate] Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Useful in conjunction with ProxyPassReverse in situations where backend URL paths are mapped to public paths on the
reverse proxy. This directive rewrites the path string in Set-Cookie headers. If the beginning of the cookie path matches internal-path , the cookie path will be replaced with public-path . In the example given with ProxyPassReverse , the directive: ProxyPassReverseCookiePath  "/"  "/mirror/foo/" will rewrite a cookie with backend path / (or /example or, in fact, anything) to /mirror/foo/ . ProxyPreserveHost Directive Description: Use incoming Host HTTP request header for proxy
request Syntax: ProxyPreserveHost On|Off Default: ProxyPreserveHost Off Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: Usable in directory
context in 2.3.3 and later. When enabled, this option will pass the Host: line from the incoming
    request to the proxied host, instead of the hostname specified in the ProxyPass line. This option should normally be turned Off . It is mostly
    useful in special configurations like proxied mass name-based virtual
    hosting, where the original Host header needs to be evaluated by the
    backend server. ProxyReceiveBufferSize Directive Description: Network buffer size for proxied HTTP and FTP
connections Syntax: ProxyReceiveBufferSize bytes Default: ProxyReceiveBufferSize 0 Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy The ProxyReceiveBufferSize directive specifies an
    explicit (TCP/IP) network buffer size for proxied HTTP and FTP connections,
    for increased throughput. It has to be greater than 512 or set
    to 0 to indicate that the system's default buffer size should
    be used. Example ProxyReceiveBufferSize 2048 ProxyRemote Directive Description: Remote proxy used to handle certain requests Syntax: ProxyRemote match remote-server [ username:password ] Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: The optional third argument is usable only in httpd 2.4.59 and later. This defines remote proxies to this proxy. match is either the
    name of a URL-scheme that the remote server supports, or a partial URL
    for which the remote server should be used, or * to indicate
    the server should be contacted for all requests. remote-server is
    a partial URL for the remote server. Syntax: remote-server = scheme :// hostname [: port ] scheme is effectively the protocol that should be used to
    communicate with the remote server; only http and https are supported by this module. When using https , the requests
    are forwarded through the remote proxy using the HTTP CONNECT method. Example ProxyRemote "http://goodguys.example.com/" "http://mirrorguys.example.com:8000"
ProxyRemote "*" "http://cleverproxy.localdomain"
ProxyRemote "ftp" "http://ftpproxy.mydomain:8080" In the last example, the proxy will forward FTP requests, encapsulated
    as yet another HTTP proxy request, to another proxy which can handle
    them. This option also supports reverse proxy configuration; a backend
    webserver can be embedded within a virtualhost URL space even if that
    server is hidden by another forward proxy. An optional third argument username:password may be
    given, which defines the Basic authentication credentials to pass
    to the configured remote proxy.  The credentials will always be
    sent without first waiting for the remote proxy to send a Basic
    authentication challenge.  The Proxy-Chain-Auth environment
    variable has no effect if this argument is used. ProxyRemoteMatch Directive Description: Remote proxy used to handle requests matched by regular
expressions Syntax: ProxyRemoteMatch regex remote-server [ username:password ] Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: The optional third argument is usable only in httpd 2.4.59 and later. The ProxyRemoteMatch is identical to the ProxyRemote directive, except that
    the first argument is a regular expression match against the requested URL. ProxyRequests Directive Description: Enables forward (standard) proxy requests Syntax: ProxyRequests On|Off Default: ProxyRequests Off Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy This allows or prevents Apache httpd from functioning as a forward proxy
    server. (Setting ProxyRequests to Off does not disable use of
    the ProxyPass directive.) In a typical reverse proxy or gateway configuration, this
    option should be set to Off . In order to get the functionality of proxying HTTP or FTP sites, you
    need also mod_proxy_http or mod_proxy_ftp (or both) present in the server. In order to get the functionality of (forward) proxying HTTPS sites, you
    need mod_proxy_connect enabled in the server. Warning Do not enable proxying with ProxyRequests until you have secured your server .  Open proxy servers are dangerous
      both to your network and to the Internet at large. See also Forward and Reverse Proxies/Gateways ProxySet Directive Description: Set various Proxy balancer or member parameters Syntax: ProxySet url key=value [key=value ...] Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: ProxySet is only available in Apache HTTP Server 2.2
  and later. This directive is used as an alternate method of setting any of the
    parameters available to Proxy balancers and workers normally done via the ProxyPass directive. If used
    within a <Proxy balancer url|worker url > container directive, the url argument is not required. As a side
    effect the respective balancer or worker gets created. This can be useful
    when doing reverse proxying via a RewriteRule instead of a ProxyPass directive. <Proxy "balancer://hotcluster">
    BalancerMember "http://www2.example.com:8080" loadfactor=1
    BalancerMember "http://www3.example.com:8080" loadfactor=2
    ProxySet lbmethod=bytraffic
</Proxy> <Proxy "http://backend">
    ProxySet keepalive=On
</Proxy> ProxySet "balancer://foo" lbmethod=bytraffic timeout=15 ProxySet "ajp://backend:7001" timeout=15 Warning Keep in mind that the same parameter key can have a different meaning
      depending whether it is applied to a balancer or a worker, as shown by
      the two examples above regarding timeout. ProxySourceAddress Directive Description: Set local IP address for outgoing proxy connections Syntax: ProxySourceAddress address Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: Available in version 2.3.9 and later This directive allows to set a specific local address to bind to when connecting
    to a backend server. ProxyStatus Directive Description: Show Proxy LoadBalancer status in mod_status Syntax: ProxyStatus Off|On|Full Default: ProxyStatus Off Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy Compatibility: Available in version 2.2 and later This directive determines whether or not proxy
    loadbalancer status data is displayed via the mod_status server-status page. Note Full is synonymous with On ProxyTimeout Directive Description: Network timeout for proxied requests Syntax: ProxyTimeout seconds Default: Value of Timeout Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy This directive allows a user to specify a timeout on proxy requests.
    This is useful when you have a slow/buggy appserver which hangs, and you
    would rather just return a timeout and fail gracefully instead of waiting
    however long it takes the server to return. ProxyVia Directive Description: Information provided in the Via HTTP response
header for proxied requests Syntax: ProxyVia On|Off|Full|Block Default: ProxyVia Off Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy This directive controls the use of the Via: HTTP
    header by the proxy. Its intended use is to control the flow of
    proxy requests along a chain of proxy servers.  See RFC 2616 (HTTP/1.1), section
    14.45 for an explanation of Via: header lines. If set to Off , which is the default, no special processing
    is performed. If a request or reply contains a Via: header,
    it is passed through unchanged. If set to On , each request and reply will get a Via: header line added for the current host. If set to Full , each generated Via: header
    line will additionally have the Apache httpd server version shown as a Via: comment field. If set to Block , every proxy request will have all its Via: header lines removed. No new Via: header will
    be generated. Available Languages: en | fr | ja Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
