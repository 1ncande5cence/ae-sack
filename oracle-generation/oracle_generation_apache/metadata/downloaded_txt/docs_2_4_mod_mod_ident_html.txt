    a connection. Directives IdentityCheck IdentityCheckTimeout Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also mod_log_config Comments IdentityCheck Directive Description: Enables logging of the RFC 1413 identity of the remote
user Syntax: IdentityCheck On|Off Default: IdentityCheck Off Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Extension Module: mod_ident Compatibility: Moved out of core in Apache 2.1 This directive enables RFC 1413 -compliant logging of the remote user name for each
    connection, where the client machine runs identd or something similar.
    This information is logged in the access log using the %...l format string . The information should not be trusted in any way except for
      rudimentary usage tracking. Note that this can cause serious latency problems accessing
    your server since every request requires one of these lookups
    to be performed. When firewalls or proxy servers are involved,
    each lookup might possibly fail and add a latency duration as
    defined by the IdentityCheckTimeout directive to each hit. So in
    general this is not very useful on public servers accessible from
    the Internet. IdentityCheckTimeout Directive Description: Determines the timeout duration for ident requests Syntax: IdentityCheckTimeout seconds Default: IdentityCheckTimeout 30 Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Extension Module: mod_ident This directive specifies the timeout duration of an ident
    request. The default value of 30 seconds is recommended by RFC 1413 , mainly because
    of possible network latency. However, you may want to adjust the
    timeout value according to your local network speed. Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
