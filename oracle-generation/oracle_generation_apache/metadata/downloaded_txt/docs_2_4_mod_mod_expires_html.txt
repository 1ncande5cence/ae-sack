mod_expires - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_expires Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Description: Generation of Expires and Cache-Control HTTP headers according to user-specified
criteria Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: expires_module SourceÂ File: mod_expires.c Summary This module controls the setting of the Expires HTTP header and the max-age directive of the Cache-Control HTTP header in server responses. The
    expiration date can set to be relative to either the time the
    source file was last modified, or to the time of the client
    access. These HTTP headers are an instruction to the client about the
    document's validity and persistence. If cached, the document may
    be fetched from the cache rather than from the source until this
    time has passed. After that, the cache copy is considered
    "expired" and invalid, and a new copy must be obtained from the
    source. To modify Cache-Control directives other than max-age (see RFC
    2616 section 14.9 ), you can use the Header directive. When the Expires header is already part of the response
    generated by the server, for example when generated by a CGI script or
    proxied from an origin server, this module does not change or add
    an Expires or Cache-Control header. Topics Alternate Interval Syntax Directives ExpiresActive ExpiresByType ExpiresDefault Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also Comments Alternate Interval Syntax The ExpiresDefault and ExpiresByType directives
    can also be defined in a more readable syntax of the form: ExpiresDefault " base [plus num type ] [ num type ] ..."
ExpiresByType type/encoding " base [plus num type ] [ num type ] ..." where base is one of: access now (equivalent to
      ' access ') modification The plus keyword is optional. num should be an integer value [acceptable to atoi() ],
    and type is one of: years months weeks days hours minutes seconds For example, any of the following directives can be used to
    make documents expire 1 month after being accessed, by
    default: ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 month"
ExpiresDefault "access plus 4 weeks"
ExpiresDefault "access plus 30 days" The expiry time can be fine-tuned by adding several
    ' num type ' clauses: ExpiresByType text/html "access plus 1 month 15 days 2 hours"
ExpiresByType image/gif "modification plus 5 hours 3 minutes" Note that if you use a modification date based setting, the
    Expires header will not be added to content
    that does not come from a file on disk. This is due to the fact
    that there is no modification time for such content. ExpiresActive Directive Description: Enables generation of Expires headers Syntax: ExpiresActive On|Off Default: ExpiresActive Off Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: Indexes Status: Extension Module: mod_expires This directive enables or disables the generation of the Expires and Cache-Control headers for
    the document realm in question.  (That is, if found in an .htaccess file, for instance, it applies only to
    documents generated from that directory.) If set to Off , the headers will not be generated for any
    document in the realm (unless overridden at a lower level, such as
    an .htaccess file overriding a server config
    file). If set to On , the headers will be added to
    served documents according to the criteria defined by the ExpiresByType and ExpiresDefault directives ( q.v. ). Note that this directive does not guarantee that an Expires or Cache-Control header will be
    generated. If the criteria aren't met, no header will be sent, and
    the effect will be as though this directive wasn't even
    specified. ExpiresByType Directive Description: Value of the Expires header configured
by MIME type Syntax: ExpiresByType MIME-type <code>seconds Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: Indexes Status: Extension Module: mod_expires This directive defines the value of the Expires header and the max-age directive of the Cache-Control header generated for documents of the
    specified type ( e.g. , text/html ). The second
    argument sets the number of seconds that will be added to a base
    time to construct the expiration date.  The Cache-Control:
    max-age is calculated by subtracting the request time from
    the expiration date and expressing the result in seconds. The base time is either the last modification time of the
    file, or the time of the client's access to the document. Which
    should be used is specified by the <code> field; M means that the file's last modification time should be used as
    the base time, and A means the client's access
    time should be used. The difference in effect is subtle. If M is used,
    all current copies of the document in all caches will expire at
    the same time, which can be good for something like a weekly
    notice that's always found at the same URL. If A is
    used, the date of expiration is different for each client; this
    can be good for image files that don't change very often,
    particularly for a set of related documents that all refer to
    the same images ( i.e. , the images will be accessed
    repeatedly within a relatively short timespan). Example: # enable expirations
ExpiresActive On
# expire GIF images after a month in the client's cache
ExpiresByType image/gif A2592000
# HTML documents are good for a week from the
# time they were changed
ExpiresByType text/html M604800 Note that this directive only has effect if ExpiresActive On has been specified. It overrides,
    for the specified MIME type only , any expiration date
    set by the ExpiresDefault directive. You can also specify the expiration time calculation using
    an alternate syntax , described earlier in
    this document. ExpiresDefault Directive Description: Default algorithm for calculating expiration time Syntax: ExpiresDefault <code>seconds Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: Indexes Status: Extension Module: mod_expires This directive sets the default algorithm for calculating the
    expiration time for all documents in the affected realm. It can be
    overridden on a type-by-type basis by the ExpiresByType directive. See the
    description of that directive for details about the syntax of the
    argument, and the alternate syntax description as well. Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
