mod_cern_meta - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_cern_meta Available Languages: en | fr | ko Description: CERN httpd metafile semantics Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: cern_meta_module SourceÂ File: mod_cern_meta.c Summary Emulate the CERN HTTPD Meta file semantics. Meta files are HTTP
    headers that can be output in addition to the normal range of
    headers for each file accessed. They appear rather like the
    Apache .asis files, and are able to provide a crude way of
    influencing the Expires: header, as well as providing other
    curiosities. There are many ways to manage meta information,
    this one was chosen because there is already a large number of
    CERN users who can exploit this module. More information on the CERN metafile semantics is available.

files Syntax: MetaDir directory Default: MetaDir .web Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: Indexes Status: Extension Module: mod_cern_meta Specifies the name of the directory in which Apache can find
    meta information files. The directory is usually a 'hidden'
    subdirectory of the directory that contains the file being
    accessed. Set to " . " to look in the same directory
    as the file: MetaDir . Or, to set it to a subdirectory of the directory containing the
    files: MetaDir .meta MetaFiles Directive Description: Activates CERN meta-file processing Syntax: MetaFiles on|off Default: MetaFiles off Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: Indexes Status: Extension Module: mod_cern_meta Turns on/off Meta file processing on a per-directory basis. MetaSuffix Directive Description: File name suffix for the file containing CERN-style
meta information Syntax: MetaSuffix suffix Default: MetaSuffix .meta Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: Indexes Status: Extension Module: mod_cern_meta Specifies the file name suffix for the file containing the
    meta information. For example, the default values for the two
    directives will cause a request to DOCUMENT_ROOT/somedir/index.html to look in DOCUMENT_ROOT/somedir/.web/index.html.meta and
    will use its contents to generate additional MIME header
    information. Example: MetaSuffix .meta Available Languages: en | fr | ko Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
