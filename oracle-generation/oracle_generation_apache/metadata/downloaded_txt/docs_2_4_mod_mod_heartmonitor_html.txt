mod_heartmonitor - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_heartmonitor Available Languages: en | fr Description: Centralized monitor for mod_heartbeat origin servers Status: Experimental ModuleÂ Identifier: heartmonitor_module SourceÂ File: mod_heartmonitor.c Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.3 and later Summary mod_heartmonitor listens for server status messages generated
by mod_heartbeat enabled origin servers and makes their status
available to mod_lbmethod_heartbeat . This allows ProxyPass to use the "heartbeat" lbmethod inside of ProxyPass . This module uses the services of mod_slotmem_shm when
available instead of flat-file storage.  No configuration is required to
use mod_slotmem_shm . To use mod_heartmonitor , mod_status and mod_watchdog must be either a static modules or, if a dynamic module, it must
        be loaded before mod_heartmonitor . Directives HeartbeatListen HeartbeatMaxServers HeartbeatStorage Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also Comments HeartbeatListen Directive Description: multicast address to listen for incoming heartbeat requests Syntax: HeartbeatListen addr:port Default: disabled Context: server config Status: Experimental Module: mod_heartmonitor The HeartbeatListen directive specifies the
    multicast address on which the server will listen for status information from mod_heartbeat -enabled servers.  This
    address will usually correspond to a configured HeartbeatAddress on an origin server. HeartbeatListen 239.0.0.1:27999 This module is inactive until this directive is used. HeartbeatMaxServers Directive Description: Specifies the maximum number of servers that will be sending
heartbeat requests to this server Syntax: HeartbeatMaxServers number-of-servers Default: HeartbeatMaxServers 10 Context: server config Status: Experimental Module: mod_heartmonitor Compatibility: The value of 0 is accepted only in 2.4.55 and above The HeartbeatMaxServers directive specifies the
    maximum number of servers that will be sending requests to this monitor
    server.  It is used to control the size of the shared memory allocated
    to store the heartbeat info when mod_slotmem_shm is in use. For using flat-file storage (without loading mod_slotmem_shm ),
    this must be set to 0. The value must be either 0, or bigger or equals 10. HeartbeatStorage Directive Description: Path to store heartbeat data when using flat-file storage Syntax: HeartbeatStorage file-path Default: HeartbeatStorage logs/hb.dat Context: server config Status: Experimental Module: mod_heartmonitor The HeartbeatStorage directive specifies the
    path to store heartbeat data.  This flat-file is used only when mod_slotmem_shm is not loaded and HeartbeatMaxServers is set to 0.
