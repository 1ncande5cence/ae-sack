mod_alias - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_alias Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko | tr Description: Provides for mapping different parts of the host
    filesystem in the document tree and for URL redirection Status: Base ModuleÂ Identifier: alias_module SourceÂ File: mod_alias.c Summary The directives contained in this module allow for manipulation
    and control of URLs as requests arrive at the server. The Alias and ScriptAlias directives are used to
    map between URLs and filesystem paths.  This allows for content
    which is not directly under the DocumentRoot served as part of the web
    document tree. The ScriptAlias directive has the
    additional effect of marking the target directory as containing
    only CGI scripts. The Redirect directives are used to instruct clients to make a new request with
    a different URL. They are often used when a resource has moved to
    a new location. When the Alias , ScriptAlias and Redirect directives are used
    within a <Location> or <LocationMatch> section, expression syntax can be used
    to manipulate the destination path or URL. mod_alias is designed to handle simple URL
    manipulation tasks.  For more complicated tasks such as
    manipulating the query string, use the tools provided by mod_rewrite .

    like other directives according to standard merging rules .  But when multiple
    Aliases or Redirects occur in the same context (for example, in the
    same <VirtualHost> section) they are processed in a particular order. First, all Redirects are processed before Aliases are processed,
    and therefore a request that matches a Redirect or RedirectMatch will never have Aliases
    applied.  Second, the Aliases and Redirects are processed in the order
    they appear in the configuration files, with the first match taking
    precedence. For this reason, when two or more of these directives apply to the
    same sub-path, you must list the most specific path first in order for
    all the directives to have an effect.  For example, the following
    configuration will work as expected: Alias "/foo/bar" "/baz"
Alias "/foo" "/gaq" But if the above two directives were reversed in order, the /foo Alias would always match before the /foo/bar Alias , so the latter directive would be
    ignored. When the Alias , ScriptAlias and Redirect directives are used
    within a <Location> or <LocationMatch> section, these directives will take precedence over any globally
    defined Alias , ScriptAlias and Redirect directives. Alias Directive Description: Maps URLs to filesystem locations Syntax: Alias [ URL-path ] file-path | directory-path Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Base Module: mod_alias The Alias directive allows documents to
    be stored in the local filesystem other than under the DocumentRoot . URLs with a
    (%-decoded) path beginning with URL-path will be mapped
    to local files beginning with directory-path .  The URL-path is case-sensitive, even on case-insensitive
    file systems. Alias "/image" "/ftp/pub/image" A request for http://example.com/image/foo.gif would cause
    the server to return the file /ftp/pub/image/foo.gif .  Only
    complete path segments are matched, so the above alias would not match a
    request for http://example.com/imagefoo.gif .  For more complex
    matching using regular expressions, see the AliasMatch directive. Note that if you include a trailing / on the URL-path then the server will require a trailing / in
    order to expand the alias. That is, if you use Alias "/icons/" "/usr/local/apache/icons/" then the URL /icons will not be aliased, as it lacks
    that trailing /. Likewise, if you omit the slash on the URL-path then you must also omit it from the file-path . Note that you may need to specify additional <Directory> sections which
    cover the destination of aliases.  Aliasing occurs before <Directory> sections
    are checked, so only the destination of aliases are affected.
    (Note however <Location> sections are run through once before aliases are performed, so
    they will apply.) In particular, if you are creating an Alias to a
    directory outside of your DocumentRoot , you may need to explicitly
    permit access to the target directory. Alias "/image" "/ftp/pub/image"
<Directory "/ftp/pub/image">
    Require all granted
</Directory> Any number slashes in the URL-path parameter
    matches any number of slashes in the requested URL-path. If the Alias directive is used within a <Location> or <LocationMatch> section the URL-path is omitted, and the file-path is interpreted
    using expression syntax . This syntax is available in Apache 2.4.19 and later. <Location "/image">
    Alias "/ftp/pub/image"
</Location>
<LocationMatch "/error/(?<NUMBER>[0-9]+)">
    Alias "/usr/local/apache/errors/%{env:MATCH_NUMBER}.html"
</LocationMatch> Note that when the AliasPreservePath directive is on, the full path is mapped to the destination. When
    the directive is off, all URLs are mapped to the single target
    URL. # /files/foo and /files/bar mapped to /ftp/pub/files/foo and /ftp/pub/files/bar
<Location "/files">
    AliasPreservePath on
    Alias "/ftp/pub/files"
</Location>
# /errors/foo and /errors/bar mapped to /var/www/errors.html
<Location "/errors">
    AliasPreservePath off
    Alias "/var/www/errors.html"
</Location> AliasMatch Directive Description: Maps URLs to filesystem locations using regular
expressions Syntax: AliasMatch regex file-path | directory-path Context: server config, virtual host Status: Base Module: mod_alias This directive is equivalent to Alias , but makes use of regular expressions ,
    instead of simple prefix matching. The
    supplied regular expression is matched against the URL-path, and
    if it matches, the server will substitute any parenthesized
    matches into the given string and use it as a filename. For
    example, to activate the /icons directory, one might
    use: AliasMatch "^/icons(/|$)(.*)" "/usr/local/apache/icons$1$2" The full range of regular expression power is available.  For example,
    it is possible to construct an alias with case-insensitive
    matching of the URL-path: AliasMatch "(?i)^/image(.*)" "/ftp/pub/image$1" One subtle difference
    between Alias and AliasMatch is
    that Alias will
    automatically copy any additional part of the URI, past the part
    that matched, onto the end of the file path on the right side,
    while AliasMatch will
    not.  This means that in almost all cases, you will want the
    regular expression to match the entire request URI from beginning
    to end, and to use substitution on the right side. In other words, just changing Alias to AliasMatch will not
    have the same effect.  At a minimum, you need to
    add ^ to the beginning of the regular expression
    and add (.*)$ to the end, and add $1 to
    the end of the replacement. For example, suppose you want to replace this with AliasMatch: Alias "/image/" "/ftp/pub/image/" This is NOT equivalent - don't do this!  This will send all
    requests that have /image/ anywhere in them to /ftp/pub/image/: AliasMatch "/image/" "/ftp/pub/image/" This is what you need to get the same effect: AliasMatch "^/image/(.*)$" "/ftp/pub/image/$1" Of course, there's no point in
    using AliasMatch where Alias would
    work. AliasMatch lets
    you do more complicated things.  For example, you could
    serve different kinds of files from different directories: AliasMatch "^/image/(.*)\.jpg$" "/files/jpg.images/$1.jpg"
AliasMatch "^/image/(.*)\.gif$" "/files/gif.images/$1.gif" Multiple leading slashes in the requested URL are discarded
       by the server before directives from this module compares
       against the requested URL-path. AliasPreservePath Directive Description: Map the full path after the alias in a location. Syntax: AliasPreservePath OFF|ON Default: AliasPreservePath OFF Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Base Module: mod_alias Compatibility: 2.4.58 and later When using the two parameter version of the Alias directive, the full path after the alias
    is preserved. When using the one parameter version of the Alias directive inside a Location directive, the full path is dropped,
    and all URLs are mapped to the target expression. To make the one parameter version of the Alias directive preserve paths in the same way
    that the two parameter version of the Alias directive, enable this setting. Redirect Directive Description: Sends an external redirect asking the client to fetch
a different URL Syntax: Redirect [ status ] [ URL-path ] URL Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: FileInfo Status: Base Module: mod_alias The Redirect directive maps an old URL into a new one by asking
    the client to refetch the resource at the new location. The old URL-path is a case-sensitive (%-decoded) path
    beginning with a slash.  A relative path is not allowed. The new URL may be either an absolute URL beginning
    with a scheme and hostname, or a URL-path beginning with a slash.
    In this latter case the scheme and hostname of the current server will
    be added. Then any request beginning with URL-path will return a
    redirect request to the client at the location of the target URL .  Additional path information beyond the matched URL-path will be appended to the target URL. # Redirect to a URL on a different host
Redirect "/service" "http://foo2.example.com/service"

# Redirect to a URL on the same host
Redirect "/one" "/two" If the client requests http://example.com/service/foo.txt ,
    it will be told to access http://foo2.example.com/service/foo.txt instead. This includes requests with GET parameters, such as http://example.com/service/foo.pl?q=23&a=42 ,
    it will be redirected to http://foo2.example.com/service/foo.pl?q=23&a=42 .
    Note that POST s will be discarded. Only complete path segments are matched, so the above
    example would not match a request for http://example.com/servicefoo.txt . For more complex matching
    using the expression syntax , omit the URL-path
    argument as described below. Alternatively, for matching using regular
    expressions, see the RedirectMatch directive. Note Redirect directives take precedence over Alias and ScriptAlias directives, irrespective of their ordering in the configuration
    file. Redirect directives inside a Location take
    precedence over Redirect and Alias directives with an URL-path . If no status argument is given, the redirect will
    be "temporary" (HTTP status 302). This indicates to the client
    that the resource has moved temporarily. The status argument can be used to return other HTTP status codes: permanent Returns a permanent redirect status (301) indicating that
      the resource has moved permanently. temp Returns a temporary redirect status (302). This is the
      default. seeother Returns a "See Other" status (303) indicating that the
      resource has been replaced. gone Returns a "Gone" status (410) indicating that the
      resource has been permanently removed. When this status is
      used the URL argument should be omitted. Other status codes can be returned by giving the numeric
    status code as the value of status . If the status is
    between 300 and 399, the URL argument must be present.
    If the status is not between 300 and 399, the URL argument must be omitted. The status must be a valid
    HTTP status code, known to the Apache HTTP Server (see the function send_error_response in http_protocol.c). Redirect permanent "/one" "http://example.com/two"
Redirect 303 "/three" "http://example.com/other" If the Redirect directive is used within a <Location> or <LocationMatch> section with the URL-path omitted, then the URL parameter
    will be interpreted using expression syntax . This syntax is available in Apache 2.4.19 and later. <Location "/one">
    Redirect permanent "http://example.com/two"
</Location>
<Location "/three">
    Redirect 303 "http://example.com/other"
</Location>
<LocationMatch "/error/(?<NUMBER>[0-9]+)">
    Redirect permanent "http://example.com/errors/%{env:MATCH_NUMBER}.html"
</LocationMatch> RedirectMatch Directive Description: Sends an external redirect based on a regular expression match
of the current URL Syntax: RedirectMatch [ status ] regex URL Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: FileInfo Status: Base Module: mod_alias This directive is equivalent to Redirect , but makes use of regular expressions ,
    instead of simple prefix matching. The
    supplied regular expression is matched against the URL-path, and
    if it matches, the server will substitute any parenthesized
    matches into the given string and use it as a filename. For
    example, to redirect all GIF files to like-named JPEG files on
    another server, one might use: RedirectMatch "(.*)\.gif$" "http://other.example.com$1.jpg" The considerations related to the difference between Alias and AliasMatch also apply to the difference between Redirect and RedirectMatch .
    See AliasMatch for
    details. RedirectPermanent Directive Description: Sends an external permanent redirect asking the client to fetch
a different URL Syntax: RedirectPermanent URL-path URL Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: FileInfo Status: Base Module: mod_alias This directive makes the client know that the Redirect is
    permanent (status 301). Exactly equivalent to Redirect
    permanent . RedirectRelative Directive Description: Allows relative redirect targets. Syntax: RedirectRelative On|Off Default: RedirectRelative Off Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Base Module: mod_alias Compatibility: 2.4.58 and later By default, if the target URL of a Redirect directive is a relative URL beginning with a '/' character, the server 
    converts it to an absolute URL before responding to the client. By
    setting RedirectRelative to the value "On",
    the relative URL is presented to the client directly. RedirectTemp Directive Description: Sends an external temporary redirect asking the client to fetch
a different URL Syntax: RedirectTemp URL-path URL Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: FileInfo Status: Base Module: mod_alias This directive makes the client know that the Redirect is
    only temporary (status 302). Exactly equivalent to Redirect temp . ScriptAlias Directive Description: Maps a URL to a filesystem location and designates the
target as a CGI script Syntax: ScriptAlias [ URL-path ] file-path | directory-path Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Base Module: mod_alias The ScriptAlias directive has the same
    behavior as the Alias directive, except that in addition it marks the target directory
    as containing CGI scripts that will be processed by mod_cgi 's cgi-script handler. URLs with a case-sensitive
    (%-decoded) path beginning with URL-path will be mapped
    to scripts beginning with the second argument, which is a full
    pathname in the local filesystem. ScriptAlias "/cgi-bin/" "/web/cgi-bin/" A request for http://example.com/cgi-bin/foo would cause the
    server to run the script /web/cgi-bin/foo .  This configuration
    is essentially equivalent to: Alias "/cgi-bin/" "/web/cgi-bin/"
<Location "/cgi-bin">
    SetHandler cgi-script
    Options +ExecCGI
</Location> ScriptAlias can also be used in conjunction with
    a script or handler you have. For example: ScriptAlias "/cgi-bin/" "/web/cgi-handler.pl" In this scenario all files requested in /cgi-bin/ will be
    handled by the file you have configured, this allows you to use your own custom
    handler.  You may want to use this as a wrapper for CGI so that you can add
    content, or some other bespoke action. It is safer to avoid placing CGI scripts under the DocumentRoot in order to
    avoid accidentally revealing their source code if the
    configuration is ever changed.  The ScriptAlias makes this easy by mapping a
    URL and designating CGI scripts at the same time.  If you do
    choose to place your CGI scripts in a directory already
    accessible from the web, do not use ScriptAlias .  Instead, use <Directory> , SetHandler , and Options as in: <Directory "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/cgi-bin">
    SetHandler cgi-script
    Options ExecCGI
</Directory> This is necessary since multiple URL-paths can map
    to the same filesystem location, potentially bypassing the ScriptAlias and revealing the source code
    of the CGI scripts if they are not restricted by a Directory section. If the ScriptAlias directive is used within
    a <Location> or <LocationMatch> section with the URL-path omitted, then the URL parameter will be
    interpreted using expression syntax . This syntax is available in Apache 2.4.19 and later. <Location "/cgi-bin">
    ScriptAlias "/web/cgi-bin/"
</Location>
<LocationMatch "/cgi-bin/errors/(?<NUMBER>[0-9]+)">
    ScriptAlias "/web/cgi-bin/errors/%{env:MATCH_NUMBER}.cgi"
</LocationMatch> See also CGI Tutorial ScriptAliasMatch Directive Description: Maps a URL to a filesystem location using a regular expression
and designates the target as a CGI script Syntax: ScriptAliasMatch regex file-path | directory-path Context: server config, virtual host Status: Base Module: mod_alias This directive is equivalent to ScriptAlias , but makes use of regular expressions ,
    instead of simple prefix matching. The
    supplied regular expression is matched against the URL-path,
    and if it matches, the server will substitute any parenthesized
    matches into the given string and use it as a filename. For
    example, to activate the standard /cgi-bin , one
    might use: ScriptAliasMatch "^/cgi-bin(.*)" "/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin$1" As for AliasMatch, the full range of regular
    expression power is available.
    For example, it is possible to construct an alias with case-insensitive
    matching of the URL-path: ScriptAliasMatch "(?i)^/cgi-bin(.*)" "/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin$1" The considerations related to the difference between Alias and AliasMatch also apply to the difference between ScriptAlias and ScriptAliasMatch .
