mod_version - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_version Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Description: Version dependent configuration Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: version_module SourceÂ File: mod_version.c Summary This module is designed for the use in test suites and large
    networks which have to deal with different httpd versions and
    different configurations. It provides a new container -- <IfVersion> , which
    allows a flexible version checking including numeric comparisons and
    regular expressions. Examples <IfVersion 2.4.2>
    # current httpd version is exactly 2.4.2
</IfVersion>

<IfVersion >= 2.5>
    # use really new features :-)
</IfVersion> See below for further possibilities. Directives <IfVersion> Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also Comments <IfVersion> Directive Description: contains version dependent configuration Syntax: <IfVersion [[!] operator ] version > ...
</IfVersion> Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Override: All Status: Extension Module: mod_version The <IfVersion> section encloses
    configuration directives which are executed only if the httpd version
    matches the desired criteria. For normal (numeric) comparisons the version argument has the format major [. minor [. patch ]] , e.g. 2.1.0 or 2.2 . minor and patch are optional. If these numbers are omitted, they are
    assumed to be zero. The following numerical operator s are
    possible: operator description = or == httpd version is equal > httpd version is greater than >= httpd version is greater or equal < httpd version is less than <= httpd version is less or equal Example <IfVersion >= 2.3>
    # this happens only in versions greater or
    # equal 2.3.0.
</IfVersion> Besides the numerical comparison it is possible to match a regular expression against the httpd version. There are two ways to write it: operator description = or == version has the form / regex / ~ version has the form regex Example <IfVersion = /^2.4.[01234]$/>
    # e.g. workaround for buggy versions
</IfVersion> In order to reverse the meaning, all operators can be preceded by an
    exclamation mark ( ! ): <IfVersion !~ ^2.4.[01234]$>
    # not for those versions
</IfVersion> If the operator is omitted, it is assumed to be = . Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
