    a user is allowed to access a resource.  mod_authz_groupfile extends the
    authorization types with group and group-file . Since v2.4.8, expressions are supported
    within the groupfile require directives. Require group This directive specifies group membership that is required for the
    user to gain access. Require group admin Require file-group When this directive is specified, the filesystem permissions on
    the file being accessed are consulted. The user must be a member of
    a group with the same name as the group that owns the file.
    See mod_authz_owner for more
    details. Require file-group AuthGroupFile Directive Description: Sets the name of a text file containing the list
of user groups for authorization Syntax: AuthGroupFile file-path Context: directory, .htaccess Override: AuthConfig Status: Base Module: mod_authz_groupfile The AuthGroupFile directive sets the
    name of a textual file containing the list of user groups for user
    authorization. File-path is the path to the group
    file. If it is not absolute, it is treated as relative to the ServerRoot . Each line of the group file contains a groupname followed by a
    colon, followed by the member usernames separated by spaces. Example: mygroup: bob joe anne Note that searching large text files is very inefficient; AuthDBMGroupFile provides a much better performance. Security Make sure that the AuthGroupFile is
      stored outside the document tree of the web-server; do not put it in the directory that it protects. Otherwise, clients may
      be able to download the AuthGroupFile . Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
