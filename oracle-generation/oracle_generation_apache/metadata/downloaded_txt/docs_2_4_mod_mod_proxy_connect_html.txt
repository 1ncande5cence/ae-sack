mod_proxy_connect - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_proxy_connect Available Languages: en | fr | ja Description: mod_proxy extension for CONNECT request handling Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: proxy_connect_module SourceÂ File: mod_proxy_connect.c Summary This module requires the service of mod_proxy . It provides support for the CONNECT HTTP method. This method is mainly used to tunnel SSL requests
    through proxy servers. Thus, in order to get the ability of handling CONNECT requests, mod_proxy and mod_proxy_connect have to be present in the server. CONNECT is also used when the server needs to send an HTTPS request
    through a forward proxy. In this case the server acts as a CONNECT client.
    This functionality is part of mod_proxy and mod_proxy_connect is not needed in this case. Warning Do not enable proxying until you have secured your server . Open proxy
      servers are dangerous both to your network and to the Internet at
      large. Topics Request notes Directives AllowCONNECT Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also mod_proxy Comments Request notes mod_proxy_connect creates the following request notes for
        logging using the %{VARNAME}n format in LogFormat or ErrorLogFormat : proxy-source-port The local port used for the connection to the backend server. AllowCONNECT Directive Description: Ports that are allowed to CONNECT through the
proxy Syntax: AllowCONNECT port [- port ]
[ port [- port ]] ... Default: AllowCONNECT 443 563 Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_proxy_connect Compatibility: Moved from mod_proxy in Apache 2.3.5.
Port ranges available since Apache 2.3.7. The AllowCONNECT directive specifies a list
    of port numbers or ranges to which the proxy CONNECT method
    may connect.  Today's browsers use this method when a https connection is requested and proxy tunneling over HTTP is in effect. By default, only the default https port ( 443 ) and the
    default snews port ( 563 ) are enabled. Use the AllowCONNECT directive to override this default and
    allow connections to the listed ports only. Available Languages: en | fr | ja Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
