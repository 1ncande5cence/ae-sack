mod_reqtimeout - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_reqtimeout Available Languages: en | fr Description: Set timeout and minimum data rate for receiving requests Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: reqtimeout_module SourceÂ File: mod_reqtimeout.c Compatibility: Available in Apache HTTPD 2.2.15 and later Summary This module provides a convenient way to set timeouts and minimum data
    rates for receiving requests. Should a timeout occur or a data rate be
    to low, the corresponding connection will be closed by the server. This is logged at LogLevel info . If needed, the LogLevel directive
    can be tweaked to explicitly log it: LogLevel reqtimeout:info Topics Examples Directives RequestReadTimeout Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also Comments Examples Allow for 5 seconds to complete the TLS handshake, 10 seconds to
        receive the request headers and 30 seconds for receiving the
        request body: RequestReadTimeout handshake=5 header=10 body=30 Allow at least 10 seconds to receive the request body.
        If the client sends data, increase the timeout by 1 second for every
        1000 bytes received, with no upper limit for the timeout (except for
        the limit given indirectly by LimitRequestBody ): RequestReadTimeout body=10,MinRate=1000 Allow at least 10 seconds to receive the request headers.
        If the client sends data, increase the timeout by 1 second for every
        500 bytes received. But do not allow more than 30 seconds for the
        request headers: RequestReadTimeout header=10-30,MinRate=500 Usually, a server should have both header and body timeouts configured.
        If a common configuration is used for http and https virtual hosts, the
        timeouts should not be set too low: RequestReadTimeout header=20-40,MinRate=500 body=20,MinRate=500 RequestReadTimeout Directive Description: Set timeout values for completing the TLS handshake, receiving
the request headers and/or body from client. Syntax: RequestReadTimeout
[handshake= timeout [- maxtimeout ][,MinRate= rate ]
[header= timeout [- maxtimeout ][,MinRate= rate ]
[body= timeout [- maxtimeout ][,MinRate= rate ] Default: RequestReadTimeout handshake=0 header=20-40,MinRate=500 body=20,MinRate=500 Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_reqtimeout Compatibility: Available in version 2.2.15 and later; defaulted to disabled in
version 2.3.14 and earlier. The handshake stage is available since
version 2.4.39. This directive can set various timeouts for completing the TLS handshake,
    receiving the request headers and/or the request body from the client.
    If the client fails to complete each of these stages within the configured
    time, a 408 REQUEST TIME OUT error is sent. For SSL virtual hosts, the handshake timeout values is the time
    needed to do the initial SSL handshake.  If the user's browser is configured to
    query certificate revocation lists and the CRL server is not reachable, the
    initial SSL handshake may take a significant time until the browser gives up
    waiting for the CRL.  Therefore the handshake timeout should take
    this possible overhead into consideration for SSL virtual hosts (if necessary).
    The body timeout values include the time needed for SSL renegotiation
    (if necessary). When an AcceptFilter is in use
    (usually the case on Linux and FreeBSD), the socket is not sent to the
    server process before at least one byte (or the whole request for httpready ) is received. The handshake and header timeouts
    configured with RequestReadTimeout are only effective
    after the server process has received the socket. For each of the three timeout stages (handshake, header or body), there are
    three ways to specify the timeout: Fixed timeout value : stage = timeout The time in seconds allowed for completing the whole stage (handshaking,
    reading all of the request headers or body). A value of 0 means no limit. Disable module for a vhost : handshake=0 header=0 body=0 This disables mod_reqtimeout completely (note that handshake=0 is the default already and could be omitted). Timeout value that is increased when data is
    received : stage = timeout ,MinRate= data_rate Same as above, but whenever data is received, the timeout value is
    increased according to the specified minimum data rate (in bytes per
    second). Timeout value that is increased when data is received, with an
    upper bound : stage = timeout - maxtimeout ,MinRate= data_rate Same as above, but the timeout will not be increased above the second
    value of the specified timeout range. Available Languages: en | fr Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
