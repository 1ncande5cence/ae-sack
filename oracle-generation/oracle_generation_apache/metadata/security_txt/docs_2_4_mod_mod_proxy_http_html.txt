mod_proxy_http - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_proxy_http Available Languages: en | fr Description: HTTP support module for mod_proxy Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: proxy_http_module SourceÂ File: mod_proxy_http.c Summary This module requires the service of mod_proxy . It provides the features used for
    proxying HTTP and HTTPS requests. mod_proxy_http supports HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1. It does not provide any caching abilities. If you want to set up a caching
    proxy, you might want to use the additional service of the mod_cache module. Thus, in order to get the ability of handling HTTP proxy requests, mod_proxy and mod_proxy_http have to be present in the server. Warning Do not enable proxying until you have secured your server . Open proxy
      servers are dangerous both to your network and to the Internet at
      large. Topics Environment Variables Request notes Directives This module provides no
            directives. Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also mod_proxy mod_proxy_connect Comments Environment Variables In addition to the configuration directives that control the
    behaviour of mod_proxy , there are a number of environment variables that control the HTTP protocol
    provider. Environment variables below that don't specify specific values
    are enabled when set to any value. proxy-sendextracrlf Causes proxy to send an extra CR-LF newline on the end of a
        request.  This is a workaround for a bug in some browsers. force-proxy-request-1.0 Forces the proxy to send requests to the backend as HTTP/1.0
        and disables HTTP/1.1 features. proxy-nokeepalive Forces the proxy to close the backend connection after
        each request. proxy-chain-auth If the proxy requires authentication, it will read and
        consume the proxy authentication credentials sent by the client.
        With proxy-chain-auth it will also forward
        the credentials to the next proxy in the chain.  This may
        be necessary if you have a chain of proxies that share
        authentication information. Security Warning: Do not set this unless you know you need it, as it forwards
        sensitive information! proxy-sendcl HTTP/1.0 required all HTTP requests that include a body
        (e.g. POST requests) to include a Content-Length header.  This environment variable forces the Apache proxy to
        send this header to the backend server, regardless of what the
        Client sent to the proxy.  It ensures compatibility when
        proxying for an HTTP/1.0 or unknown backend.  However, it
        may require the entire request to be buffered by the proxy,
        so it becomes very inefficient for large requests. proxy-sendchunks or proxy-sendchunked This is the opposite of proxy-sendcl .  It allows
        request bodies to be sent to the backend using chunked transfer
        encoding.  This allows the request to be efficiently streamed,
        but requires that the backend server supports HTTP/1.1. proxy-interim-response This variable takes values RFC (the default) or Suppress .  Earlier httpd versions would suppress
        HTTP interim (1xx) responses sent from the backend.  This is
        technically a violation of the HTTP protocol.  In practice,
        if a backend sends an interim response, it may itself be
        extending the protocol in a manner we know nothing about,
        or just broken.  So this is now configurable: set proxy-interim-response RFC to be fully protocol
        compliant, or proxy-interim-response Suppress to suppress interim responses. proxy-initial-not-pooled If this variable is set, no pooled connection will be reused
        if the client request is the initial request on the frontend connection. This avoids
        the "proxy: error reading status line from remote server" error message
        caused by the race condition that the backend server closed the
        pooled connection after the connection check by the proxy and
        before data sent by the proxy reached the backend. It has to be
        kept in mind that setting this variable downgrades performance,
        especially with HTTP/1.0 clients. Request notes mod_proxy_http creates the following request notes for
        logging using the %{VARNAME}n format in LogFormat or ErrorLogFormat : proxy-source-port The local port used for the connection to the backend server. proxy-status The HTTP status received from the backend server.
