mod_access_compat - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_access_compat Available Languages: en | fr | ja Description: Group authorizations based on host (name or IP
address) Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: access_compat_module SourceÂ File: mod_access_compat.c Compatibility: Available in Apache HTTP Server 2.3 as a compatibility module with
previous versions of Apache httpd 2.x.  The directives provided by this module
have been deprecated by the new authz refactoring.  Please see mod_authz_host Summary The directives provided by mod_access_compat are
    used in <Directory> , <Files> , and <Location> sections
    as well as .htaccess files to control access to particular parts of the server.
    Access can be controlled based on the client hostname, IP address, or
    other characteristics of the client request, as captured in environment variables . The Allow and Deny directives are used to
    specify which clients are or are not allowed access to the server,
    while the Order directive sets the default access state, and configures how the Allow and Deny directives interact with each
    other. Both host-based access restrictions and password-based
    authentication may be implemented simultaneously. In that case,
    the Satisfy directive is used
    to determine how the two sets of restrictions interact. Note The directives provided by mod_access_compat have
      been deprecated by mod_authz_host . 
      Mixing old directives like Order , Allow or Deny with new ones like Require is technically possible 
      but discouraged. This module was created to support 
      configurations containing only old directives to facilitate the 2.4 upgrade. 
      Please check the upgrading guide for more
      information. In general, access restriction directives apply to all
    access methods ( GET , PUT , POST , etc). This is the desired behavior in most
    cases. However, it is possible to restrict some methods, while
    leaving other methods unrestricted, by enclosing the directives
    in a <Limit> section. Merging of configuration sections When any directive provided by this module is used in a new 
      configuration section, no directives provided by this module are
      inherited from previous configuration sections. Directives Allow Deny Order Satisfy Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also Require mod_authz_host mod_authz_core Comments Allow Directive Description: Controls which hosts can access an area of the
server Syntax: Allow from all| host |env=[!] env-variable [ host |env=[!] env-variable ] ... Context: directory, .htaccess Override: Limit Status: Extension Module: mod_access_compat The Allow directive affects which hosts can
    access an area of the server. Access can be controlled by
    hostname, IP address, IP address range, or by other
    characteristics of the client request captured in environment
    variables. The first argument to this directive is always from . The subsequent arguments can take three
    different forms. If Allow from all is specified, then
    all hosts are allowed access, subject to the configuration of the Deny and Order directives as discussed
    below. To allow only particular hosts or groups of hosts to access
    the server, the host can be specified in any of the
    following formats: A (partial) domain-name Allow from example.org
Allow from .net example.edu Hosts whose names match, or end in, this string are allowed
      access. Only complete components are matched, so the above
      example will match foo.example.org but it will not
      match fooexample.org . This configuration will cause
      Apache httpd to perform a double DNS lookup on the client IP
      address, regardless of the setting of the HostnameLookups directive.  It will do
      a reverse DNS lookup on the IP address to find the associated
      hostname, and then do a forward lookup on the hostname to assure
      that it matches the original IP address.  Only if the forward
      and reverse DNS are consistent and the hostname matches will
      access be allowed. A full IP address Allow from 10.1.2.3
Allow from 192.168.1.104 192.168.1.205 An IP address of a host allowed access A partial IP address Allow from 10.1
Allow from 10 172.20 192.168.2 The first 1 to 3 bytes of an IP address, for subnet
      restriction. A network/netmask pair Allow from 10.1.0.0/255.255.0.0 A network a.b.c.d, and a netmask w.x.y.z. For more
      fine-grained subnet restriction. A network/nnn CIDR specification Allow from 10.1.0.0/16 Similar to the previous case, except the netmask consists of
      nnn high-order 1 bits. Note that the last three examples above match exactly the
    same set of hosts. IPv6 addresses and IPv6 subnets can be specified as shown
    below: Allow from 2001:db8::a00:20ff:fea7:ccea
Allow from 2001:db8::a00:20ff:fea7:ccea/10 The third format of the arguments to the Allow directive allows access to the server
    to be controlled based on the existence of an environment variable . When Allow from
    env= env-variable is specified, then the request is
    allowed access if the environment variable env-variable exists. When Allow from env=! env-variable is
    specified, then the request is allowed access if the environment
    variable env-variable doesn't exist.
    The server provides the ability to set environment
    variables in a flexible way based on characteristics of the client
    request using the directives provided by mod_setenvif . Therefore, this directive can be
    used to allow access based on such factors as the clients User-Agent (browser type), Referer , or
    other HTTP request header fields. SetEnvIf User-Agent ^KnockKnock/2\.0 let_me_in
<Directory "/docroot">
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from env=let_me_in
</Directory> In this case, browsers with a user-agent string beginning
    with KnockKnock/2.0 will be allowed access, and all
    others will be denied. Merging of configuration sections When any directive provided by this module is used in a new 
      configuration section, no directives provided by this module are
      inherited from previous configuration sections. Deny Directive Description: Controls which hosts are denied access to the
server Syntax: Deny from all| host |env=[!] env-variable [ host |env=[!] env-variable ] ... Context: directory, .htaccess Override: Limit Status: Extension Module: mod_access_compat This directive allows access to the server to be restricted
    based on hostname, IP address, or environment variables. The
    arguments for the Deny directive are
    identical to the arguments for the Allow directive. Order Directive Description: Controls the default access state and the order in which Allow and Deny are
evaluated. Syntax: Order ordering Default: Order Deny,Allow Context: directory, .htaccess Override: Limit Status: Extension Module: mod_access_compat The Order directive, along with the Allow and Deny directives,
    controls a three-pass access control system. The first pass
    processes either all Allow or all Deny directives, as specified
    by the Order directive. The second pass parses the rest of the directives
    ( Deny or Allow ). The third
    pass applies to all requests which do not match either of the first
    two. Note that all Allow and Deny directives are
    processed, unlike a typical firewall, where only the first match is
    used. The last match is effective (also unlike a typical firewall).
    Additionally, the order in which lines appear in the configuration
    files is not significant -- all Allow lines are processed as
    one group, all Deny lines are considered as
    another, and the default state is considered by itself. Ordering is one of: Allow,Deny First, all Allow directives are
      evaluated; at least one must match, or the request is rejected.
      Next, all Deny directives are evaluated. If any matches, the request is rejected.
      Last, any requests which do not match an Allow or a Deny directive are denied
      by default. Deny,Allow First, all Deny directives are
      evaluated; if any match, the request is denied unless it also matches an Allow directive. Any
      requests which do not match any Allow or Deny directives are
      permitted. Mutual-failure This order has the same effect as Order
      Allow,Deny and is deprecated in its favor. Keywords may only be separated by a comma; no whitespace is allowed between them. Match Allow,Deny result Deny,Allow result Match Allow only Request allowed Request allowed Match Deny only Request denied Request denied No match Default to second directive: Denied Default to second directive: Allowed Match both Allow & Deny Final match controls: Denied Final match controls: Allowed In the following example, all hosts in the example.org domain
    are allowed access; all other hosts are denied access. Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
Allow from example.org In the next example, all hosts in the example.org domain are
    allowed access, except for the hosts which are in the
    foo.example.org subdomain, who are denied access. All hosts not
    in the example.org domain are denied access because the default
    state is to Deny access to the server. Order Allow,Deny
Allow from example.org
Deny from foo.example.org On the other hand, if the Order in the
    last example is changed to Deny,Allow , all hosts will
    be allowed access. This happens because, regardless of the actual
    ordering of the directives in the configuration file, the Allow from example.org will be evaluated last and will
    override the Deny from foo.example.org . All hosts not in
    the example.org domain will also be allowed access
    because the default state is Allow . The presence of an Order directive can
    affect access to a part of the server even in the absence of
    accompanying Allow and Deny directives because of its effect on the default access state. For
    example, <Directory "/www">
    Order Allow,Deny
</Directory> will Deny all access to the /www directory
    because the default access state is set to Deny . The Order directive controls the order of access
    directive processing only within each phase of the server's
    configuration processing. This implies, for example, that an Allow or Deny directive occurring in a <Location> section will
    always be evaluated after an Allow or Deny directive occurring in a <Directory> section or .htaccess file, regardless of the setting of the Order directive. For details on the merging
    of configuration sections, see the documentation on How Directory, Location and Files sections
    work . Merging of configuration sections When any directive provided by this module is used in a new 
      configuration section, no directives provided by this module are
      inherited from previous configuration sections. Satisfy Directive Description: Interaction between host-level access control and
user authentication Syntax: Satisfy Any|All Default: Satisfy All Context: directory, .htaccess Override: AuthConfig Status: Extension Module: mod_access_compat Compatibility: Influenced by <Limit> and <LimitExcept> in version 2.0.51 and
later Access policy if both Allow and Require used. The parameter can be
    either All or Any . This directive is only
    useful if access to a particular area is being restricted by both
    username/password and client host address. In this case
    the default behavior ( All ) is to require that the client
    passes the address access restriction and enters a valid
    username and password. With the Any option the client will be
    granted access if they either pass the host restriction or enter a
    valid username and password. This can be used to password restrict
    an area, but to let clients from particular addresses in without
    prompting for a password. For example, if you wanted to let people on your network have
    unrestricted access to a portion of your website, but require that
    people outside of your network provide a password, you could use a
    configuration similar to the following: Require valid-user
Allow from 192.168.1
Satisfy Any Another frequent use of the Satisfy directive
    is to relax access restrictions for a subdirectory: <Directory "/var/www/private">
    Require valid-user
</Directory>

<Directory "/var/www/private/public">
    Allow from all
    Satisfy Any
</Directory> In the above example, authentication will be required for the /var/www/private directory, but will not be required
    for the /var/www/private/public directory. Since version 2.0.51 Satisfy directives can
    be restricted to particular methods by <Limit> and <LimitExcept> sections. Merging of configuration sections When any directive provided by this module is used in a new 
      configuration section, no directives provided by this module are
