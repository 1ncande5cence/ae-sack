mod_authn_core - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_authn_core Available Languages: en | fr Description: Core Authentication Status: Base ModuleÂ Identifier: authn_core_module SourceÂ File: mod_authn_core.c Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.3 and later Summary This module provides core authentication capabilities to
    allow or deny access to portions of the web site. mod_authn_core provides directives that are
    common to all authentication providers. Topics Creating Authentication Provider Aliases Directives AuthName <AuthnProviderAlias> AuthType Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also Comments Creating Authentication Provider Aliases Extended authentication providers can be created
    within the configuration file and assigned an alias name.  The alias
    providers can then be referenced through the directives AuthBasicProvider or AuthDigestProvider in
    the same way as a base authentication provider.  Besides the ability
    to create and alias an extended provider, it also allows the same
    extended authentication provider to be reference by multiple
    locations. Examples This example checks for passwords in two different text
        files. Checking multiple text password files # Check here first
<AuthnProviderAlias file file1>
    AuthUserFile "/www/conf/passwords1"
</AuthnProviderAlias>

# Then check here
<AuthnProviderAlias file file2>   
    AuthUserFile "/www/conf/passwords2"
</AuthnProviderAlias>

<Directory "/var/web/pages/secure">
    AuthBasicProvider file1 file2
    
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Protected Area"
    Require valid-user
</Directory> The example below creates two different ldap authentication
        provider aliases based on the ldap provider.  This allows
        a single authenticated location to be serviced by multiple ldap
        hosts: Checking multiple LDAP servers <AuthnProviderAlias ldap ldap-alias1>
    AuthLDAPBindDN cn=youruser,o=ctx
    AuthLDAPBindPassword yourpassword
    AuthLDAPURL ldap://ldap.host/o=ctx
</AuthnProviderAlias>
<AuthnProviderAlias ldap ldap-other-alias>
    AuthLDAPBindDN cn=yourotheruser,o=dev
    AuthLDAPBindPassword yourotherpassword
    AuthLDAPURL ldap://other.ldap.host/o=dev?cn
</AuthnProviderAlias>

Alias "/secure" "/webpages/secure"
<Directory "/webpages/secure">
    AuthBasicProvider ldap-other-alias  ldap-alias1
    
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "LDAP Protected Place"
    Require valid-user
    # Note that Require ldap-* would not work here, since the 
    # AuthnProviderAlias does not provide the config to authorization providers
    # that are implemented in the same module as the authentication provider.
</Directory> AuthName Directive Description: Authorization realm for use in HTTP
authentication Syntax: AuthName auth-domain Context: directory, .htaccess Override: AuthConfig Status: Base Module: mod_authn_core This directive sets the name of the authorization realm for a
    directory. This realm is given to the client so that the user
    knows which username and password to send. AuthName takes a single argument; if the
    realm name contains spaces, it must be enclosed in quotation
    marks.  It must be accompanied by AuthType and Require directives, and directives such
    as AuthUserFile and AuthGroupFile to
    work. For example: AuthName "Top Secret" The string provided for the AuthName is what will
    appear in the password dialog provided by most browsers. From 2.4.55, expression syntax can be
    used inside the directive to produce the name dynamically. For example: AuthName "%{HTTP_HOST}" See also Authentication, Authorization, and
    Access Control mod_authz_core <AuthnProviderAlias> Directive Description: Enclose a group of directives that represent an
extension of a base authentication provider and referenced by
the specified alias Syntax: <AuthnProviderAlias baseProvider Alias >
... </AuthnProviderAlias> Context: server config Status: Base Module: mod_authn_core <AuthnProviderAlias> and </AuthnProviderAlias> are used to enclose a group of
    authentication directives that can be referenced by the alias name
    using one of the directives AuthBasicProvider or AuthDigestProvider . This directive has no affect on authorization, even for modules that
    provide both authentication and authorization. AuthType Directive Description: Type of user authentication Syntax: AuthType None|Basic|Digest|Form Context: directory, .htaccess Override: AuthConfig Status: Base Module: mod_authn_core This directive selects the type of user authentication for a
    directory. The authentication types available are None , Basic (implemented by mod_auth_basic ), Digest (implemented by mod_auth_digest ), and Form (implemented by mod_auth_form ). To implement authentication, you must also use the AuthName and Require directives.  In addition, the
    server must have an authentication-provider module such as mod_authn_file and an authorization module such
    as mod_authz_user . The authentication type None disables authentication.
    When authentication is enabled, it is normally inherited by each
    subsequent configuration section ,
    unless a different authentication type is specified.  If no
    authentication is desired for a subsection of an authenticated
    section, the authentication type None may be used;
    in the following example, clients may access the /www/docs/public directory without authenticating: <Directory "/www/docs">
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName Documents
    AuthBasicProvider file
    AuthUserFile "/usr/local/apache/passwd/passwords"
    Require valid-user
</Directory>

<Directory "/www/docs/public">
    AuthType None
    Require all granted
</Directory> From 2.4.55, expression syntax can be
    used inside the directive to specify the type dynamically. When disabling authentication, note that clients which have
    already authenticated against another portion of the server's document
    tree will typically continue to send authentication HTTP headers
    or cookies with each request, regardless of whether the server
    actually requires authentication for every resource. See also Authentication, Authorization,
