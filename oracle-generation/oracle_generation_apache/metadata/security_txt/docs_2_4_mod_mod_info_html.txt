mod_info - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_info Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Description: Provides a comprehensive overview of the server
configuration Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: info_module SourceÂ File: mod_info.c Summary To configure mod_info , add the following to your httpd.conf file. <Location "/server-info">
    SetHandler server-info
</Location> You may wish to use mod_authz_host inside the <Location> directive to limit access to your server configuration
    information: <Location "/server-info">
    SetHandler server-info
    Require host example.com
</Location> Once configured, the server information is obtained by
    accessing http://your.host.example.com/server-info Topics Security Issues Selecting the information shown Dumping the configuration on startup Known Limitations Directives AddModuleInfo Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also Comments Security Issues Once mod_info is loaded into the server, its
    handler capability is available in all configuration
    files, including per-directory files ( e.g. , .htaccess ). This may have security-related
    ramifications for your site. In particular, this module can leak sensitive information
    from the configuration directives of other Apache modules such as
    system paths, usernames/passwords, database names, etc. Therefore,
    this module should only be
    used in a controlled environment and always with caution. You will probably want to use mod_authz_host to limit access to your server configuration information. Access control <Location "/server-info">
    SetHandler server-info
    # Allow access from server itself
    Require ip 127.0.0.1

    # Additionally, allow access from local workstation
    Require ip 192.168.1.17
</Location> Selecting the information shown By default, the server information includes a list of
    all enabled modules, and for each module, a description of
    the directives understood by that module, the hooks implemented
    by that module, and the relevant directives from the current
    configuration. Other views of the configuration information are available by
    appending a query to the server-info request. For
    example, http://your.host.example.com/server-info?config will show all configuration directives. ?<module-name> Only information relevant to the named module ?config Just the configuration directives, not sorted by module ?hooks Only the list of Hooks each module is attached to ?list Only a simple list of enabled modules ?server Only the basic server information ?providers List the providers that are available on your server Dumping the configuration on startup If the config define -DDUMP_CONFIG is set, mod_info will dump the pre-parsed configuration to stdout during server startup. httpd -DDUMP_CONFIG -k start Pre-parsed means that directives like <IfDefine> and <IfModule> are
    evaluated and environment variables are replaced. However it does
    not represent the final state of the configuration. In particular,
    it does not represent the merging or overriding that may happen
    for repeated directives. This is roughly equivalent to the ?config query. Known Limitations mod_info provides its information by reading the
    parsed configuration, rather than reading the original configuration
    file. There are a few limitations as a result of the way the parsed
    configuration tree is created: Directives which are executed immediately rather than being
          stored in the parsed configuration are not listed. These include ServerRoot , LoadModule , and LoadFile . Directives which control the configuration file itself, such as Include , <IfModule> and <IfDefine> are not
          listed, but the included configuration directives are. Comments are not listed. (This may be considered a feature.) Configuration directives from .htaccess files are
          not listed (since they do not form part of the permanent server
          configuration). Container directives such as <Directory> are listed normally, but mod_info cannot figure
          out the line number for the closing </Directory> . Directives generated by third party modules such as mod_perl might not be listed. AddModuleInfo Directive Description: Adds additional information to the module
information displayed by the server-info handler Syntax: AddModuleInfo module-name string Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_info This allows the content of string to be shown as
    HTML interpreted, Additional Information for
    the module module-name . Example: AddModuleInfo mod_deflate.c 'See <a \
