mod_authz_dbm - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_authz_dbm Available Languages: en | fr | ko Description: Group authorization using DBM files Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: authz_dbm_module SourceÂ File: mod_authz_dbm.c Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.1 and later Summary This module provides authorization capabilities so that
       authenticated users can be allowed or denied access to portions
       of the web site by group membership. Similar functionality is
       provided by mod_authz_groupfile . Topics The Require Directives Example usage Directives AuthDBMGroupFile AuthzDBMType Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also Require Comments The Require Directives Apache's Require directives are used during the authorization phase to ensure that
    a user is allowed to access a resource.  mod_authz_dbm extends the
    authorization types with dbm-group . Since v2.4.8, expressions are supported
    within the DBM require directives. Require dbm-group This directive specifies group membership that is required for the
    user to gain access. Require dbm-group admin Require dbm-file-group When this directive is specified, the user must be a member of the group
    assigned to the file being accessed. Require dbm-file-group Example usage Note that using mod_authz_dbm requires you to require dbm-group instead of group : <Directory "/foo/bar">
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Secure Area"
  AuthBasicProvider dbm
  AuthDBMUserFile "site/data/users"
  AuthDBMGroupFile "site/data/users"
  Require dbm-group admin
</Directory> AuthDBMGroupFile Directive Description: Sets the name of the database file containing the list
of user groups for authorization Syntax: AuthDBMGroupFile file-path Context: directory, .htaccess Override: AuthConfig Status: Extension Module: mod_authz_dbm The AuthDBMGroupFile directive sets the
    name of a DBM file containing the list of user groups for user
    authorization. File-path is the absolute path to the
    group file. The group file is keyed on the username. The value for a
    user is a comma-separated list of the groups to which the users
    belongs. There must be no whitespace within the value, and it
    must never contain any colons. Security Make sure that the AuthDBMGroupFile is
      stored outside the document tree of the web-server. Do not put it in the directory that it protects.
      Otherwise, clients will be able to download the AuthDBMGroupFile unless otherwise
      protected. Combining Group and Password DBM files: In some cases it is
    easier to manage a single database which contains both the
    password and group details for each user. This simplifies any
    support programs that need to be written: they now only have to
    deal with writing to and locking a single DBM file. This can be
    accomplished by first setting the group and password files to
    point to the same DBM: AuthDBMGroupFile "/www/userbase"
AuthDBMUserFile "/www/userbase" The key for the single DBM is the username. The value consists
    of Encrypted Password : List of Groups [ : (ignored) ] The password section contains the encrypted
    password as before. This is followed by a colon and the comma
    separated list of groups. Other data may optionally be left in the
    DBM file after another colon; it is ignored by the authorization
    module. This is what www.telescope.org uses for its combined
    password and group database. AuthzDBMType Directive Description: Sets the type of database file that is used to
store list of user groups Syntax: AuthzDBMType default|SDBM|GDBM|NDBM|DB Default: AuthzDBMType default Context: directory, .htaccess Override: AuthConfig Status: Extension Module: mod_authz_dbm Sets the type of database file that is used to store the list
    of user groups.
    The default database type is determined at compile time.  The
    availability of other types of database files also depends on compile-time settings . It is crucial that whatever program you use to create your group
    files is configured to use the same type of database. Available Languages: en | fr | ko Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
