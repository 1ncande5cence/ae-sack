Â Â LogMessage "/foo/ has been requested"
</Location> Log message if request to /foo/* is processed in a sub-request: <Location "/foo/">
Â Â LogMessage "subrequest to /foo/" hook=type_checker "expr=-T %{IS_SUBREQ}"
</Location> The default log_transaction hook is not executed for sub-requests,
        therefore we have to use a different hook. Log message if an IPv6 client causes a request timeout: LogMessage "IPv6 timeout from %{REMOTE_ADDR}" "expr=-T %{IPV6} && %{REQUEST_STATUS} = 408" Note the placing of the double quotes for the expr= argument. Log the value of the "X-Foo" request environment variable in each
        stage of the request: <Location "/">
Â Â LogMessage "%{reqenv:X-Foo}" hook=all
</Location> Together with microsecond time stamps in the error log, hook=all also lets you determine the times spent
        in the different parts of the request processing. LogMessage Directive Description: Log user-defined message to error log Syntax: LogMessage message [hook= hook ] [expr= expression ] Default: Unset Context: directory Status: Experimental Module: mod_log_debug This directive causes a user defined message to be logged to the
    error log. The message can use variables and functions from the ap_expr syntax . References to HTTP headers
    will not cause header names to be added to the Vary header. The
    messages are logged at loglevel info. The hook specifies before which phase of request processing the message
    will be logged. The following hooks are supported: Name pre_translate_name translate_name type_checker quick_handler map_to_storage check_access check_access_ex insert_filter check_authn check_authz fixups handler log_transaction The default is log_transaction . The special value all is also supported, causing a message to be logged at each
    phase. Not all hooks are executed for every request. The optional expression allows to restrict the message if a
    condition is met. The details of the expression syntax are described in
    the ap_expr documentation . References to HTTP
    headers will not cause the header names to be added to the Vary header. Available Languages: en | fr Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
