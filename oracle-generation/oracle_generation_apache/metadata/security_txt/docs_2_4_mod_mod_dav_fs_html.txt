Directives DavLockDB DavLockDiscovery Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also mod_dav Comments DavLockDB Directive Description: Location of the DAV lock database Syntax: DavLockDB file-path Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_dav_fs Use the DavLockDB directive to specify
    the full path to the lock database, excluding an extension. If
    the path is not absolute, it will be taken relative to ServerRoot . The implementation of mod_dav_fs uses a SDBM database to track user
    locks. Example DavLockDB "var/DavLock" The directory containing the lock database file must be
    writable by the User and Group under which
    Apache is running.  For security reasons, you should create a
    directory for this purpose rather than changing the permissions on
    an existing directory.  In the above example, Apache will create
    files in the var/ directory under the ServerRoot with the base filename DavLock and extension name chosen by the server.
