mod_ldap - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_ldap Available Languages: en | fr Description: LDAP connection pooling and result caching services for use
by other LDAP modules Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: ldap_module SourceÂ File: util_ldap.c Summary This module was created to improve the performance of
    websites relying on backend connections to LDAP servers. In
    addition to the functions provided by the standard LDAP
    libraries, this module adds an LDAP connection pool and an LDAP
    shared memory cache. To enable this module, LDAP support must be compiled into
    apr-util. This is achieved by adding the --with-ldap flag to the configure script when building
    Apache. SSL/TLS support is dependent on which LDAP toolkit has been
    linked to APR . As of this writing, APR-util supports: OpenLDAP SDK (2.x or later), Novell LDAP
    SDK , Mozilla LDAP SDK , native Solaris LDAP SDK (Mozilla based) or the
    native Microsoft LDAP SDK. See the APR website for details.

</Location> LDAP Connection Pool LDAP connections are pooled from request to request. This
    allows the LDAP server to remain connected and bound ready for
    the next request, without the need to unbind/connect/rebind.
    The performance advantages are similar to the effect of HTTP
    keepalives. On a busy server it is possible that many requests will try
    and access the same LDAP server connection simultaneously.
    Where an LDAP connection is in use, Apache will create a new
    connection alongside the original one. This ensures that the
    connection pool does not become a bottleneck. There is no need to manually enable connection pooling in
    the Apache configuration. Any module using this module for
    access to LDAP services will share the connection pool. LDAP connections can keep track of the ldap client
    credentials used when binding to an LDAP server. These
    credentials can be provided to LDAP servers that do not
    allow anonymous binds during referral chasing. To control
    this feature, see the LDAPReferrals and LDAPReferralHopLimit directives. By default, this feature is enabled. LDAP Cache For improved performance, mod_ldap uses an aggressive
    caching strategy to minimize the number of times that the LDAP
    server must be contacted. Caching can easily double or triple
    the throughput of Apache when it is serving pages protected
    with mod_authnz_ldap . In addition, the load on the LDAP server
    will be significantly decreased. mod_ldap supports two types of LDAP caching during
    the search/bind phase with a search/bind cache and
    during the compare phase with two operation
    caches . Each LDAP URL that is used by the server has
    its own set of these three caches. The Search/Bind Cache The process of doing a search and then a bind is the
      most time-consuming aspect of LDAP operation, especially if
      the directory is large. The search/bind cache is used to
      cache all searches that resulted in successful binds.
      Negative results ( i.e. , unsuccessful searches, or searches
      that did not result in a successful bind) are not cached.
      The rationale behind this decision is that connections with
      invalid credentials are only a tiny percentage of the total
      number of connections, so by not caching invalid
      credentials, the size of the cache is reduced. mod_ldap stores the username, the DN
      retrieved, the password used to bind, and the time of the bind
      in the cache. Whenever a new connection is initiated with the
      same username, mod_ldap compares the password
      of the new connection with the password in the cache. If the
      passwords match, and if the cached entry is not too old, mod_ldap bypasses the search/bind phase. The search and bind cache is controlled with the LDAPCacheEntries and LDAPCacheTTL directives. Operation Caches During attribute and distinguished name comparison
      functions, mod_ldap uses two operation caches
      to cache the compare operations. The first compare cache is
      used to cache the results of compares done to test for LDAP
      group membership. The second compare cache is used to cache
      the results of comparisons done between distinguished
      names. Note that, when group membership is being checked, any sub-group
      comparison results are cached to speed future sub-group comparisons. The behavior of both of these caches is controlled with
      the LDAPOpCacheEntries and LDAPOpCacheTTL directives. Monitoring the Cache mod_ldap has a content handler that allows
      administrators to monitor the cache performance. The name of
      the content handler is ldap-status , so the
      following directives could be used to access the mod_ldap cache information: <Location "/server/cache-info">
    SetHandler ldap-status
</Location> By fetching the URL http://servername/cache-info ,
      the administrator can get a status report of every cache that is used
      by mod_ldap cache. Note that if Apache does not
      support shared memory, then each httpd instance has its
      own cache, so reloading the URL will result in different
      information each time, depending on which httpd instance processes the request. Using SSL/TLS The ability to create an SSL and TLS connections to an LDAP server
    is defined by the directives LDAPTrustedGlobalCert , LDAPTrustedClientCert and LDAPTrustedMode .
    These directives specify the CA and optional client certificates to be used,
    as well as the type of encryption to be used on the connection (none, SSL or
    TLS/STARTTLS). # Establish an SSL LDAP connection on port 636. Requires that
# mod_ldap and mod_authnz_ldap be loaded. Change the
# "yourdomain.example.com" to match your domain.

</Location> SSL/TLS Certificates The different LDAP SDKs have widely different methods of setting
    and handling both CA and client side certificates. If you intend to use SSL or TLS, read this section CAREFULLY so as to
    understand the differences between configurations on the different LDAP
    toolkits supported. Netscape/Mozilla/iPlanet SDK CA certificates are specified within a file called cert7.db.
        The SDK will not talk to any LDAP server whose certificate was
        not signed by a CA specified in this file. If
        client certificates are required, an optional key3.db file may
        be specified with an optional password. The secmod file can be
        specified if required. These files are in the same format as
        used by the Netscape Communicator or Mozilla web browsers. The easiest
        way to obtain these files is to grab them from your browser
        installation. Client certificates are specified per connection using the LDAPTrustedClientCert directive by referring
        to the certificate "nickname". An optional password may be
        specified to unlock the certificate's private key. The SDK supports SSL only. An attempt to use STARTTLS will cause
        an error when an attempt is made to contact the LDAP server at
        runtime. # Specify a Netscape CA certificate file

</Location> Novell SDK One or more CA certificates must be specified for the Novell
        SDK to work correctly. These certificates can be specified as
        binary DER or Base64 (PEM) encoded files. Note: Client certificates are specified globally rather than per
        connection, and so must be specified with the LDAPTrustedGlobalCert directive as below. Trying to set client certificates via the LDAPTrustedClientCert directive will cause an error to be logged
        when an attempt is made to connect to the LDAP server. The SDK supports both SSL and STARTTLS, set using the LDAPTrustedMode parameter.
        If an ldaps:// URL is specified,
        SSL mode is forced, override this directive. # Specify two CA certificate files

#LDAPTrustedClientCert CERT_BASE64 "/certs/cert1.pem" OpenLDAP SDK One or more CA certificates must be specified for the OpenLDAP
        SDK to work correctly. These certificates can be specified as
        binary DER or Base64 (PEM) encoded files. Both CA and client certificates may be specified globally
        ( LDAPTrustedGlobalCert ) or
        per-connection ( LDAPTrustedClientCert ).
        When any settings are specified per-connection, the global
        settings are superseded. The documentation for the SDK claims to support both SSL and
        STARTTLS, however STARTTLS does not seem to work on all versions
        of the SDK. The SSL/TLS mode can be set using the
        LDAPTrustedMode parameter. If an ldaps:// URL is specified,
        SSL mode is forced. The OpenLDAP documentation notes that SSL
        (ldaps://) support has been deprecated to be replaced with TLS,
        although the SSL functionality still works. # Specify two CA certificate files

</Location> Solaris SDK SSL/TLS for the native Solaris LDAP libraries is not yet
        supported. If required, install and use the OpenLDAP libraries
        instead. Microsoft SDK SSL/TLS certificate configuration for the native Microsoft
        LDAP libraries is done inside the system registry, and no
        configuration directives are required. Both SSL and TLS are supported by using the ldaps:// URL
        format, or by using the LDAPTrustedMode directive accordingly. Note: The status of support for client certificates is not yet known
        for this toolkit. LDAPCacheEntries Directive Description: Maximum number of entries in the primary LDAP cache Syntax: LDAPCacheEntries number Default: LDAPCacheEntries 1024 Context: server config Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap Specifies the maximum size of the primary LDAP cache. This
    cache contains successful search/binds. Set it to 0 to turn off
    search/bind caching. The default size is 1024 cached
    searches. LDAPCacheTTL Directive Description: Time that cached items remain valid Syntax: LDAPCacheTTL seconds Default: LDAPCacheTTL 600 Context: server config Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap Specifies the time (in seconds) that an item in the
    search/bind cache remains valid. The default is 600 seconds (10
    minutes). LDAPConnectionPoolTTL Directive Description: Discard backend connections that have been sitting in the connection pool too long Syntax: LDAPConnectionPoolTTL n Default: LDAPConnectionPoolTTL -1 Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap Compatibility: Apache HTTP Server 2.3.12 and later Specifies the maximum age, in seconds, that a pooled LDAP connection can remain idle
    and still be available for use.  Connections are cleaned up when they are next needed,
    not asynchronously. A setting of 0 causes connections to never be saved in the backend
    connection pool.  The default value of -1, and any other negative value,
    allows connections of any age to be reused. For performance reasons, the reference time used by this directive is
    based on when the LDAP connection is returned to the pool, not the time
    of the last successful I/O with the LDAP server. Since 2.4.10, new measures are in place to avoid the reference time
    from being inflated by cache hits or slow requests.  First, the reference
    time is not updated if no backend LDAP conncetions were needed. Second,
    the reference time uses the time the HTTP request was received instead
    of the time the request is completed. This timeout defaults to units of seconds, but accepts
    suffixes for milliseconds (ms), minutes (min), and hours (h). LDAPConnectionTimeout Directive Description: Specifies the socket connection timeout in seconds Syntax: LDAPConnectionTimeout seconds Context: server config Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap This directive configures the LDAP_OPT_NETWORK_TIMEOUT (or LDAP_OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT)
    option in the underlying LDAP client library, when available.  This value
    typically controls how long the LDAP client library will wait for the TCP
    connection to the LDAP server to complete. If a connection is not successful with the timeout period, either an error will be
    returned or the LDAP client library will attempt to connect to a secondary LDAP
    server if one is specified (via a space-separated list of hostnames in the AuthLDAPURL ). The default is 10 seconds, if the LDAP client library linked with the
    server supports the LDAP_OPT_NETWORK_TIMEOUT option. LDAPConnectionTimeout is only available when the LDAP client library linked
    with the server supports the LDAP_OPT_NETWORK_TIMEOUT
    (or LDAP_OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT) option, and the ultimate behavior is
    dictated entirely by the LDAP client library. LDAPLibraryDebug Directive Description: Enable debugging in the LDAP SDK Syntax: LDAPLibraryDebug 7 Default: disabled Context: server config Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap Turns on SDK-specific LDAP debug options that generally cause the LDAP
    SDK to log verbose trace information to the main Apache error log.
    The trace messages from the LDAP SDK provide gory details that
    can be useful during debugging of connectivity problems with backend LDAP servers This option is only configurable when Apache HTTP Server is linked with
    an LDAP SDK that implements LDAP_OPT_DEBUG or LDAP_OPT_DEBUG_LEVEL , such as OpenLDAP (a value of 7 is verbose)
    or Tivoli Directory Server (a value of 65535 is verbose). The logged information will likely contain plaintext credentials being used or
    validated by LDAP authentication, so care should be taken in protecting and purging
    the error log when this directive is used. LDAPOpCacheEntries Directive Description: Number of entries used to cache LDAP compare
operations Syntax: LDAPOpCacheEntries number Default: LDAPOpCacheEntries 1024 Context: server config Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap This specifies the number of entries mod_ldap will use to cache LDAP compare operations. The default is 1024
    entries.  Setting it to 0 disables operation caching. LDAPOpCacheTTL Directive Description: Time that entries in the operation cache remain
valid Syntax: LDAPOpCacheTTL seconds Default: LDAPOpCacheTTL 600 Context: server config Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap Specifies the time (in seconds) that entries in the
    operation cache remain valid. The default is 600 seconds. LDAPReferralHopLimit Directive Description: The maximum number of referral hops to chase before terminating an LDAP query. Syntax: LDAPReferralHopLimit number Default: SDK dependent, typically between 5 and 10 Context: directory, .htaccess Override: AuthConfig Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap This directive, if enabled by the LDAPReferrals directive,
    limits the number of referral hops that are followed before terminating an
    LDAP query. Support for this tunable is uncommon in LDAP SDKs. LDAPReferrals Directive Description: Enable referral chasing during queries to the LDAP server. Syntax: LDAPReferrals On|Off|default Default: LDAPReferrals On Context: directory, .htaccess Override: AuthConfig Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap Compatibility: The default parameter is available in Apache 2.4.7 and later Some LDAP servers divide their directory among multiple domains and use referrals
    to direct a client when a domain boundary is crossed. This is similar to a HTTP redirect.
    LDAP client libraries may or may not chase referrals by default. This directive
    explicitly configures the referral chasing in the underlying SDK. LDAPReferrals takes the following values: "on" When set to "on", the underlying SDK's referral chasing state
              is enabled, LDAPReferralHopLimit is used to
              override the SDK's hop limit, and an LDAP rebind callback is
              registered. "off" When set to "off", the underlying SDK's referral chasing state
              is disabled completely. "default" When set to "default", the underlying SDK's referral chasing state
              is not changed, LDAPReferralHopLimit is not
              used to override the SDK's hop limit, and no LDAP rebind callback is
              registered. The directive LDAPReferralHopLimit works in conjunction with
    this directive to limit the number of referral hops to follow before terminating the LDAP query.
    When referral processing is enabled by a value of "On", client credentials will be provided,
    via a rebind callback, for any LDAP server requiring them. LDAPRetries Directive Description: Configures the number of LDAP server retries. Syntax: LDAPRetries number-of-retries Default: LDAPRetries 3 Context: server config Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap The server will retry failed LDAP requests up to LDAPRetries times.  Setting this
    directive to 0 disables retries. LDAP errors such as timeouts and refused connections are retryable. LDAPRetryDelay Directive Description: Configures the delay between LDAP server retries. Syntax: LDAPRetryDelay seconds Default: LDAPRetryDelay 0 Context: server config Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap If LDAPRetryDelay is set to a non-zero
    value, the server will delay retrying an LDAP request for the
    specified amount of time.  Setting this directive to 0 will
    result in any retry to occur without delay. LDAP errors such as timeouts and refused connections are retryable. LDAPSharedCacheFile Directive Description: Sets the shared memory cache file Syntax: LDAPSharedCacheFile directory-path/filename Context: server config Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap Specifies the directory path and file name of the shared memory
    cache file. If not set, anonymous shared memory will be used if the
    platform supports it. LDAPSharedCacheSize Directive Description: Size in bytes of the shared-memory cache Syntax: LDAPSharedCacheSize bytes Default: LDAPSharedCacheSize 500000 Context: server config Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap Specifies the number of bytes to allocate for the shared
    memory cache. The default is 500kb. If set to 0, shared memory
    caching will not be used and every HTTPD process will create its
    own cache. LDAPTimeout Directive Description: Specifies the timeout for LDAP search and bind operations, in seconds Syntax: LDAPTimeout seconds Default: LDAPTimeout 60 Context: server config Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap Compatibility: Apache HTTP Server 2.3.5 and later This directive configures the timeout for bind and search operations, as well as
    the LDAP_OPT_TIMEOUT option in the underlying LDAP client library, when available. If the timeout expires, httpd will retry in case an existing connection has
    been silently dropped by a firewall. However, performance will be much better if
    the firewall is configured to send TCP RST packets instead of silently dropping
    packets. Timeouts for ldap compare operations requires an SDK with LDAP_OPT_TIMEOUT, such as OpenLDAP >= 2.4.4. LDAPTrustedClientCert Directive Description: Sets the file containing or nickname referring to a per
connection client certificate. Not all LDAP toolkits support per
connection client certificates. Syntax: LDAPTrustedClientCert type directory-path/filename/nickname [password] Context: directory, .htaccess Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap It specifies the directory path, file name or nickname of a
    per connection client certificate used when establishing an SSL
    or TLS connection to an LDAP server. Different locations or
    directories may have their own independent client certificate
    settings. Some LDAP toolkits (notably Novell)
    do not support per connection client certificates, and will throw an
    error on LDAP server connection if you try to use this directive
    (Use the LDAPTrustedGlobalCert directive instead for Novell client
    certificates - See the SSL/TLS certificate guide above for details).
    The type specifies the kind of certificate parameter being
    set, depending on the LDAP toolkit being used. Supported types are: CA_DER - binary DER encoded CA certificate CA_BASE64 - PEM encoded CA certificate CERT_DER - binary DER encoded client certificate CERT_BASE64 - PEM encoded client certificate CERT_NICKNAME - Client certificate "nickname" (Netscape SDK) KEY_DER - binary DER encoded private key KEY_BASE64 - PEM encoded private key LDAPTrustedGlobalCert Directive Description: Sets the file or database containing global trusted
Certificate Authority or global client certificates Syntax: LDAPTrustedGlobalCert type directory-path/filename [password] Context: server config Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap It specifies the directory path and file name of the trusted CA
    certificates and/or system wide client certificates mod_ldap should use when establishing an SSL or TLS connection to an LDAP
    server. Note that all certificate information specified using this directive
    is applied globally to the entire server installation. Some LDAP toolkits
    (notably Novell) require all client certificates to be set globally using
    this directive. Most other toolkits require clients certificates to be set
    per Directory or per Location using LDAPTrustedClientCert . If you get this
    wrong, an error may be logged when an attempt is made to contact the LDAP
    server, or the connection may silently fail (See the SSL/TLS certificate
    guide above for details).
    The type specifies the kind of certificate parameter being
    set, depending on the LDAP toolkit being used. Supported types are: CA_DER - binary DER encoded CA certificate CA_BASE64 - PEM encoded CA certificate CA_CERT7_DB - Netscape cert7.db CA certificate database file CA_SECMOD - Netscape secmod database file CERT_DER - binary DER encoded client certificate CERT_BASE64 - PEM encoded client certificate CERT_KEY3_DB - Netscape key3.db client certificate database file CERT_NICKNAME - Client certificate "nickname" (Netscape SDK) CERT_PFX - PKCS#12 encoded client certificate (Novell SDK) KEY_DER - binary DER encoded private key KEY_BASE64 - PEM encoded private key KEY_PFX - PKCS#12 encoded private key (Novell SDK) LDAPTrustedMode Directive Description: Specifies the SSL/TLS mode to be used when connecting to an LDAP server. Syntax: LDAPTrustedMode type Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap The following modes are supported: NONE - no encryption SSL - ldaps:// encryption on default port 636 TLS - STARTTLS encryption on default port 389 Not all LDAP toolkits support all the above modes. An error message
    will be logged at runtime if a mode is not supported, and the
    connection to the LDAP server will fail. If an ldaps:// URL is specified, the mode becomes SSL and the setting
    of LDAPTrustedMode is ignored. LDAPVerifyServerCert Directive Description: Force server certificate verification Syntax: LDAPVerifyServerCert On|Off Default: LDAPVerifyServerCert On Context: server config Status: Extension Module: mod_ldap Specifies whether to force the verification of a
    server certificate when establishing an SSL connection to the
    LDAP server. Available Languages: en | fr Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
