mod_brotli - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_brotli Available Languages: en | fr Description: Compress content via Brotli before it is delivered to the
client Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: brotli_module SourceÂ File: mod_brotli.c Compatibility: Available in version 2.4.26 and later. Summary The mod_brotli module provides
    the BROTLI_COMPRESS output filter that allows output from
    your server to be compressed using the brotli compression format before being sent to the client over
    the network. This module uses the Brotli library found at https://github.com/google/brotli . Topics Sample Configurations Enabling Compression Dealing with proxy servers Serving pre-compressed

        attack when a TLS connection carries compressed data. For more
        information, review the details of the "BREACH" family of attacks. This is a simple configuration that compresses common text-based content types.

        attack when a TLS connection carries compressed data. For more
        information, review the details of the "BREACH" family of attacks. Output Compression Compression is implemented by the BROTLI_COMPRESS filter . The following directive
      will enable compression for documents in the container where it
      is placed: SetOutputFilter BROTLI_COMPRESS
SetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI \.(?:gif|jpe?g|png)$ no-brotli If you want to restrict the compression to particular MIME types
      in general, you may use the AddOutputFilterByType directive. Here is an example of
      enabling compression only for the html files of the Apache
      documentation: <Directory "/your-server-root/manual">
    AddOutputFilterByType BROTLI_COMPRESS text/html
</Directory> Note The BROTLI_COMPRESS filter is always inserted after RESOURCE
        filters like PHP or SSI. It never touches internal subrequests. Note There is an environment variable no-brotli ,
        set via SetEnv , which
        will disable brotli compression for a particular request, even if
        it is supported by the client. Dealing with proxy servers The mod_brotli module sends a Vary:
    Accept-Encoding HTTP response header to alert proxies that
    a cached response should be sent only to clients that send the
    appropriate Accept-Encoding request header.  This
    prevents compressed content from being sent to a client that will
    not understand it. If you use some special exclusions dependent
    on, for example, the User-Agent header, you must
    manually configure an addition to the Vary header
    to alert proxies of the additional restrictions.  For example,
    in a typical configuration where the addition of the BROTLI_COMPRESS filter depends on the User-Agent , you should add: Header append Vary User-Agent If your decision about compression depends on other information
    than request headers ( e.g. HTTP version), you have to set the Vary header to the value * . This prevents
    compliant proxies from caching entirely. Example Header set Vary * Serving pre-compressed
content Since mod_brotli re-compresses content each
    time a request is made, some performance benefit can be derived by
    pre-compressing the content and telling mod_brotli to serve them
    without re-compressing them. This may be accomplished using a
    configuration like the following: <IfModule mod_headers.c>
    # Serve brotli compressed CSS files if they exist
    # and the client accepts brotli.
    RewriteCond "%{HTTP:Accept-encoding}" "br"
    RewriteCond "%{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.br" "-s"
    RewriteRule "^(.*)\.css"              "$1\.css\.br" [QSA]

    # Serve brotli compressed JS files if they exist
    # and the client accepts brotli.
    RewriteCond "%{HTTP:Accept-encoding}" "br"
    RewriteCond "%{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.br" "-s"
    RewriteRule "^(.*)\.js"               "$1\.js\.br" [QSA]


    # Serve correct content types, and prevent double compression.
    RewriteRule "\.css\.br$" "-" [T=text/css,E=no-brotli:1]
    RewriteRule "\.js\.br$"  "-" [T=text/javascript,E=no-brotli:1]


    <FilesMatch "(\.js\.br|\.css\.br)$">
      # Serve correct encoding type.
      Header append Content-Encoding br

      # Force proxies to cache brotli &
      # non-brotli css/js files separately.
      Header append Vary Accept-Encoding
    </FilesMatch>
</IfModule> BrotliAlterETag Directive Description: How the outgoing ETag header should be modified during compression Syntax: BrotliAlterETag AddSuffix|NoChange|Remove Default: BrotliAlterETag AddSuffix Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_brotli The BrotliAlterETag directive specifies
    how the ETag hader should be altered when a response is compressed. AddSuffix Append the compression method onto the end of the ETag, causing
        compressed and uncompressed representations to have unique ETags.
        In another dynamic compression module, mod_deflate, this has been
        the default since 2.4.0. This setting prevents serving "HTTP Not
        Modified" (304) responses to conditional requests for compressed
        content. NoChange Don't change the ETag on a compressed response. In another dynamic
        compression module, mod_deflate, this has been the default prior to
        2.4.0. This setting does not satisfy the HTTP/1.1 property that all
        representations of the same resource have unique ETags. Remove Remove the ETag header from compressed responses. This prevents
        some conditional requests from being possible, but avoids the
        shortcomings of the preceding options. BrotliCompressionMaxInputBlock Directive Description: Maximum input block size Syntax: BrotliCompressionMaxInputBlock value Default: (automatic) Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_brotli The BrotliCompressionMaxInputBlock directive specifies
    the maximum input block size between 16 and 24, with the caveat that
    larger block sizes require more memory. BrotliCompressionQuality Directive Description: Compression quality Syntax: BrotliCompressionQuality value Default: BrotliCompressionQuality 5 Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_brotli The BrotliCompressionQuality directive specifies
    the compression quality (a value between 0 and 11). Higher quality values
    result in better, but also slower compression. BrotliCompressionWindow Directive Description: Brotli sliding compression window size Syntax: BrotliCompressionWindow value Default: BrotliCompressionWindow 18 Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_brotli The BrotliCompressionWindow directive specifies the
    brotli sliding compression window size (a value between 10 and 24). Larger
    window sizes can improve compression quality, but require more memory. BrotliFilterNote Directive Description: Places the compression ratio in a note for logging Syntax: BrotliFilterNote [ type ] notename Context: server config, virtual host Status: Extension Module: mod_brotli The BrotliFilterNote directive
    specifies that a note about compression ratios should be attached
    to the request. The name of the note is the value specified for
    the directive. You can use that note for statistical purposes by
    adding the value to your access log . Example BrotliFilterNote ratio

LogFormat '"%r" %b (%{ratio}n) "%{User-agent}i"' brotli
CustomLog "logs/brotli_log" brotli If you want to extract more accurate values from your logs, you
    can use the type argument to specify the type of data
    left as a note for logging. type can be one of: Input Store the byte count of the filter's input stream in the note. Output Store the byte count of the filter's output stream in the note. Ratio Store the compression ratio ( output/input * 100 )
      in the note. This is the default, if the type argument
      is omitted. Thus you may log it this way: Accurate Logging BrotliFilterNote Input instream
BrotliFilterNote Output outstream
BrotliFilterNote Ratio ratio

LogFormat '"%r" %{outstream}n/%{instream}n (%{ratio}n%%)' brotli
CustomLog "logs/brotli_log" brotli See also mod_log_config Available Languages: en | fr Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
