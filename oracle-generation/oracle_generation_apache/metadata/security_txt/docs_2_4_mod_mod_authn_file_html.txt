mod_authn_file - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_authn_file Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Description: User authentication using text files Status: Base ModuleÂ Identifier: authn_file_module SourceÂ File: mod_authn_file.c Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.1 and later Summary This module provides authentication front-ends such as mod_auth_digest and mod_auth_basic to authenticate users by looking up users in plain text password files.
    Similar functionality is provided by mod_authn_dbm . When using mod_auth_basic or mod_auth_digest , this module is invoked via the AuthBasicProvider or AuthDigestProvider with the file value.

passwords for authentication Syntax: AuthUserFile file-path Context: directory, .htaccess Override: AuthConfig Status: Base Module: mod_authn_file The AuthUserFile directive sets the name
    of a textual file containing the list of users and passwords for
    user authentication. File-path is the path to the user
    file. If it is not absolute, it is treated as relative to the ServerRoot . Each line of the user file contains a username followed by
    a colon, followed by the encrypted password. If the same user
    ID is defined multiple times, mod_authn_file will
    use the first occurrence to verify the password. The encrypted password format depends on which authentication
    frontend (e.g. mod_auth_basic or mod_auth_digest ) is being used.  See Password Formats for
    more information. For mod_auth_basic , use the utility htpasswd which is installed as part of the binary distribution, or which
    can be found in src/support . See the man page for more details.
    In short: Create a password file Filename with username as the initial ID. It will prompt for
    the password: htpasswd -c Filename username Add or modify username2 in the password file Filename : htpasswd Filename username2 Note that searching large text files is very inefficient; AuthDBMUserFile should be used
    instead. For mod_auth_digest , use htdigest instead. Note that you cannot mix user data for Digest Authentication
    and Basic Authentication within the same file. Security Make sure that the AuthUserFile is
      stored outside the document tree of the web-server. Do not put it in the directory that it protects.
      Otherwise, clients may be able to download the AuthUserFile . Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
