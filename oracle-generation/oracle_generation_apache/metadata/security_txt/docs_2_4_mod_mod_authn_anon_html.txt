mod_authn_anon - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_authn_anon Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Description: Allows "anonymous" user access to authenticated
    areas Status: Extension ModuleÂ Identifier: authn_anon_module SourceÂ File: mod_authn_anon.c Compatibility: Available in Apache 2.1 and later Summary This module provides authentication front-ends such as mod_auth_basic to authenticate users similar
    to anonymous-ftp sites, i.e. have a 'magic' user id
    'anonymous' and the email address as a password. These email
    addresses can be logged. Combined with other (database) access control methods, this
    allows for effective user tracking and customization according
    to a user profile while still keeping the site open for
    'unregistered' users. One advantage of using Auth-based user
    tracking is that, unlike magic-cookies and funny URL
    pre/postfixes, it is completely browser independent and it
    allows users to share URLs. When using mod_auth_basic , this module is invoked
    via the AuthBasicProvider directive with the anon value.

    authentication and allows users in additionally as 'guests' with the
    following properties: It insists that the user enters a userID.
      ( Anonymous_NoUserID ) It insists that the user enters a password.
      ( Anonymous_MustGiveEmail ) The password entered must be a valid email address, i.e. contain at least one '@' and a '.'.
      ( Anonymous_VerifyEmail ) The userID must be one of anonymous guest www test
      welcome and comparison is not case
      sensitive. ( Anonymous ) And the Email addresses entered in the passwd field are
      logged to the error log file.

    AuthName "Use 'anonymous' & Email address for guest entry"

</Directory> Anonymous Directive Description: Specifies userIDs that are allowed access without
password verification Syntax: Anonymous user [ user ] ... Context: directory, .htaccess Override: AuthConfig Status: Extension Module: mod_authn_anon A list of one or more 'magic' userIDs which are allowed
    access without password verification. The userIDs are space
    separated. It is possible to use the ' and " quotes to allow a
    space in a userID as well as the \ escape character. Please note that the comparison is case-IN-sensitive . It's strongly recommended that the magic username
    ' anonymous ' is always one of the allowed
    userIDs. Example: Anonymous anonymous "Not Registered" "I don't know" This would allow the user to enter without password
    verification by using the userIDs "anonymous",
    "AnonyMous", "Not Registered" and "I Don't Know". As of Apache 2.1 it is possible to specify the userID as
    " * ". That allows any supplied userID to be
    accepted. Anonymous_LogEmail Directive Description: Sets whether the password entered will be logged in the
error log Syntax: Anonymous_LogEmail On|Off Default: Anonymous_LogEmail On Context: directory, .htaccess Override: AuthConfig Status: Extension Module: mod_authn_anon When set On , the default, the 'password' entered
    (which hopefully contains a sensible email address) is logged in
    the error log. Anonymous_MustGiveEmail Directive Description: Specifies whether blank passwords are allowed Syntax: Anonymous_MustGiveEmail On|Off Default: Anonymous_MustGiveEmail On Context: directory, .htaccess Override: AuthConfig Status: Extension Module: mod_authn_anon Specifies whether the user must specify an email address as
    the password. This prohibits blank passwords. Anonymous_NoUserID Directive Description: Sets whether the userID field may be empty Syntax: Anonymous_NoUserID On|Off Default: Anonymous_NoUserID Off Context: directory, .htaccess Override: AuthConfig Status: Extension Module: mod_authn_anon When set On , users can leave the userID (and
    perhaps the password field) empty. This can be very convenient for
    MS-Explorer users who can just hit return or click directly on the
    OK button; which seems a natural reaction. Anonymous_VerifyEmail Directive Description: Sets whether to check the password field for a correctly
formatted email address Syntax: Anonymous_VerifyEmail On|Off Default: Anonymous_VerifyEmail Off Context: directory, .htaccess Override: AuthConfig Status: Extension Module: mod_authn_anon When set On the 'password' entered is checked for
    at least one '@' and a '.' to encourage users to enter valid email
    addresses (see the above Anonymous_LogEmail ). Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
