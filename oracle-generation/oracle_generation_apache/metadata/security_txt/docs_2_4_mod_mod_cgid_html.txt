mod_cgid - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_cgid Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Description: Execution of CGI scripts using an
    external CGI daemon Status: Base ModuleÂ Identifier: cgid_module SourceÂ File: mod_cgid.c Compatibility: Unix threaded MPMs only Summary Except for the optimizations and the additional ScriptSock directive noted below, mod_cgid behaves similarly to mod_cgi . See the mod_cgi summary for additional details
    about Apache and CGI. On certain unix operating systems, forking a process from a
    multi-threaded server is a very expensive operation because the
    new process will replicate all the threads of the parent
    process. In order to avoid incurring this expense on each CGI
    invocation, mod_cgid creates an external daemon that is
    responsible for forking child processes to run CGI scripts. The
    main server communicates with this daemon using a unix domain
    socket. This module is used by default instead of mod_cgi whenever a multi-threaded MPM
    is selected during the compilation process. At the user level,
    this module is identical in configuration and operation to mod_cgi . The only exception is the
    additional directive ScriptSock which gives the
    name of the socket to use for communication with the cgi
    daemon. Directives CGIDScriptTimeout ScriptLog ScriptLogBuffer ScriptLogLength ScriptSock Bugfix checklist httpd changelog Known issues Report a bug See also mod_cgi Running CGI programs under different
    user IDs Comments CGIDScriptTimeout Directive Description: The length of time to wait for more output from the
CGI program Syntax: CGIDScriptTimeout time [s|ms] Default: value of Timeout directive when 
unset or set to 0 Context: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Status: Base Module: mod_cgid Compatibility: Available in httpd 2.4.10 and later; in prior releases no timeout was applied This directive limits the length of time to wait for more output from
    the CGI program.  If the time is exceeded, the request and CGI are 
    terminated. Example CGIDScriptTimeout 20 ScriptSock Directive Description: The filename prefix of the socket to use for communication with
the cgi daemon Syntax: ScriptSock file-path Default: ScriptSock cgisock Context: server config Status: Base Module: mod_cgid This directive sets the filename prefix of the socket to use for
    communication with the CGI daemon, an extension corresponding to
    the process ID of the server will be appended. The socket will be opened
    using the permissions of the user who starts Apache (usually
    root). To maintain the security of communications with CGI
    scripts, it is important that no other user has permission to
    write in the directory where the socket is located. If file-path is not an absolute path, the location specified
    will be relative to the value of DefaultRuntimeDir . Example ScriptSock /var/run/cgid.sock Available Languages: en | fr | ja | ko Comments Notice: This is not a Q&A section.
