mod_remoteip - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Modules | Directives | FAQ | Glossary | Sitemap Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4 Apache > HTTP Server > Documentation > Version 2.4 > Modules Apache Module mod_remoteip Available Languages: en | fr Description: Replaces the original client IP address for the connection
with the useragent IP address list presented by a proxies or a load balancer
via the request headers. Status: Base ModuleÂ Identifier: remoteip_module SourceÂ File: mod_remoteip.c Summary This module is used to treat the useragent which initiated the
    request as the originating useragent as identified by httpd for the
    purposes of authorization and logging, even where that useragent is
    behind a load balancer, front end server, or proxy server. The module overrides the client IP address for the connection
    with the useragent IP address reported in the request header configured
    with the RemoteIPHeader directive. Additionally, this module implements the server side of
    HAProxy's PROXY Protocol when
    using the RemoteIPProxyProtocol directive. Once replaced as instructed, this overridden useragent IP address is
    then used for the mod_authz_host Require ip feature, is reported by mod_status , and is recorded by mod_log_config %a and core %a format strings. The underlying client IP of the connection
    is available in the %{c}a format string. It is critical to only enable this behavior from
    intermediate hosts (proxies, etc) which are trusted by this server, since
    it is trivial for the remote useragent to impersonate another
    useragent.

    client_ip value, and the connection remote_host and remote_logname are
    derived from this value. These fields play a role in authentication,
    authorization and logging and other purposes by other loadable
    modules. mod_remoteip overrides the client IP of the connection with the
    advertised useragent IP as provided by a proxy or load balancer, for
    the duration of the request. A load balancer might establish a long
    lived keepalive connection with the server, and each request will
    have the correct useragent IP, even though the underlying client IP
    address of the load balancer remains unchanged. When multiple, comma delimited useragent IP addresses are listed in the
    header value, they are processed in Right-to-Left order.  Processing
    halts when a given useragent IP address is not trusted to present the
    preceding IP address.  The header field is updated to this remaining
    list of unconfirmed IP addresses, or if all IP addresses were trusted,
    this header is removed from the request altogether. In overriding the client IP, the module stores the list of intermediate
    hosts in a remoteip-proxy-ip-list note, which mod_log_config can record using the %{remoteip-proxy-ip-list}n format token.
    If the administrator needs to store this as an additional header, this
    same value can also be recording as a header using the directive RemoteIPProxiesHeader . IPv4-over-IPv6 Mapped Addresses As with httpd in general, any IPv4-over-IPv6 mapped addresses are recorded
    in their IPv4 representation. Internal (Private) Addresses All internal addresses 10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16, 169.254/16 and 127/8
    blocks (and IPv6 addresses outside of the public 2000::/3 block) are only
    evaluated by mod_remoteip when RemoteIPInternalProxy internal (intranet) proxies are registered. RemoteIPHeader Directive Description: Declare the header field which should be parsed for useragent IP addresses Syntax: RemoteIPHeader header-field Default: none Context: server config, virtual host Status: Base Module: mod_remoteip The RemoteIPHeader directive triggers mod_remoteip to treat the value of the specified header-field header as the useragent IP address, or list
    of intermediate useragent IP addresses, subject to further configuration
    of the RemoteIPInternalProxy and RemoteIPTrustedProxy directives.  Unless these
    other directives are used, mod_remoteip will trust all
    hosts presenting a RemoteIPHeader IP value. Internal (Load Balancer) Example RemoteIPHeader X-Client-IP Proxy Example RemoteIPHeader X-Forwarded-For RemoteIPInternalProxy Directive Description: Declare client intranet IP addresses trusted to present the RemoteIPHeader value Syntax: RemoteIPInternalProxy proxy-ip | proxy-ip/subnet | hostname ... Context: server config, virtual host Status: Base Module: mod_remoteip The RemoteIPInternalProxy directive adds one
    or more addresses (or address blocks) to trust as presenting a valid
    RemoteIPHeader value of the useragent IP.  Unlike the RemoteIPTrustedProxy directive, any IP address
    presented in this header, including private intranet addresses, are
    trusted when passed from these proxies. Internal (Load Balancer) Example RemoteIPHeader X-Client-IP

    a file parsed at startup, and builds a list of addresses (or address blocks)
    to trust as presenting a valid RemoteIPHeader value of the useragent IP. The ' # ' hash character designates a comment line, otherwise
    each whitespace or newline separated entry is processed identically to
    the RemoteIPInternalProxy directive. Internal (Load Balancer) Example RemoteIPHeader X-Client-IP

    a header into which mod_remoteip will collect a list of
    all of the intermediate client IP addresses trusted to resolve the useragent
    IP of the request. Note that intermediate RemoteIPTrustedProxy addresses are recorded in
    this header, while any intermediate RemoteIPInternalProxy addresses are discarded. Example RemoteIPHeader X-Forwarded-For
RemoteIPProxiesHeader X-Forwarded-By RemoteIPProxyProtocol Directive Description: Enable or disable PROXY protocol handling Syntax: RemoteIPProxyProtocol On|Off Context: server config, virtual host Status: Base Module: mod_remoteip Compatibility: RemoteIPProxyProtocol is only available in httpd 2.4.31 and newer The RemoteIPProxyProtocol directive enables or 
    disables the reading and handling of the PROXY protocol connection header.
    If enabled with the On flag, the upstream client must send the header every time it opens a connection or the connection will
    be aborted unless it is in the list of disabled hosts provided by the RemoteIPProxyProtocolExceptions directive. While this directive may be specified in any virtual host, it is
    important to understand that because the PROXY protocol is connection
    based and protocol agnostic, the enabling and disabling is actually based
    on IP address and port. This means that if you have multiple name-based
    virtual hosts for the same host and port, and you enable it for any one of
    them, then it is enabled for all of them (with that host and port). It also
    means that if you attempt to enable the PROXY protocol in one and disable
    in the other, that won't work; in such a case, the last one wins and a
    notice will be logged indicating which setting was being overridden. Listen 80

</VirtualHost> RemoteIPProxyProtocolExceptions Directive Description: Disable processing of PROXY header for certain hosts or networks Syntax: RemoteIPProxyProtocolExceptions host|range [host|range] [host|range] Context: server config, virtual host Status: Base Module: mod_remoteip Compatibility: RemoteIPProxyProtocolExceptions is only available in httpd 2.4.31 and newer The RemoteIPProxyProtocol directive enables or
    disables the reading and handling of the PROXY protocol connection header.
    Sometimes it is desirable to require clients to provide the PROXY header, but
    permit other clients to connect without it. This directive allows a server 
    administrator to configure a single host or CIDR range of hosts that may do
    so. This is generally useful for monitoring and administrative traffic to a 
    virtual host direct to the server behind the upstream load balancer. RemoteIPTrustedProxy Directive Description: Declare client intranet IP addresses trusted to present the RemoteIPHeader value Syntax: RemoteIPTrustedProxy proxy-ip | proxy-ip/subnet | hostname ... Context: server config, virtual host Status: Base Module: mod_remoteip The RemoteIPTrustedProxy directive adds one
    or more addresses (or address blocks) to trust as presenting a valid
    RemoteIPHeader value of the useragent IP.  Unlike the RemoteIPInternalProxy directive, any intranet
    or private IP address reported by such proxies, including the 10/8, 172.16/12,
    192.168/16, 169.254/16 and 127/8 blocks (or outside of the IPv6 public
    2000::/3 block) are not trusted as the useragent IP, and are left in the RemoteIPHeader header's value. Trusted (Load Balancer) Example RemoteIPHeader X-Forwarded-For
