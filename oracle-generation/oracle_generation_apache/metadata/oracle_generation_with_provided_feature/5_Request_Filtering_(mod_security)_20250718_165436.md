### Can a Security Oracle Be Generated?

**Assessment:**  
Based on the provided document, there is **no information about mod_security** or any equivalent request filtering module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4 documentation. The document covers a wide range of modules (mod_authz_*, mod_proxy, mod_ssl, mod_headers, etc.), but **mod_security is not included**. There is also no mention of request filtering, custom rule-based blocking, or WAF (Web Application Firewall) features in the core server or any of the listed modules.

**Conclusion:**  
A security oracle for "Request Filtering (mod_security)" **cannot be generated** from the provided documentation, because:

- **mod_security is not documented or referenced** in the provided materials.
- There are **no configuration directives, examples, or testable behaviors** for request filtering or WAF-like features in the document.
- The document does not describe any mechanism for blocking or filtering HTTP requests based on custom rules, signatures, or patterns.

**If you need a security oracle for mod_security, please provide documentation or configuration examples for mod_security itself, or request an oracle for a feature that is covered in the provided Apache HTTP Server documentation.**
