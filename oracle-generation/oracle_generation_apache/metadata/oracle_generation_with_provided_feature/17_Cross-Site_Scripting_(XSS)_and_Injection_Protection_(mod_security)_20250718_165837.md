## Assessment

Based on the provided document, there is **no mention of mod_security** or any equivalent built-in Apache HTTP Server module that provides generic web application firewall (WAF) features such as XSS and SQL injection protection. The documentation covers many modules (mod_auth*, mod_proxy, mod_ssl, mod_headers, etc.), but **mod_security is not included** in the standard Apache HTTP Server 2.4 documentation.

Therefore, a security oracle for "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Injection Protection (mod_security)" **cannot be generated** based on the provided document.

---

### Why a Security Oracle Cannot Be Generated

- **mod_security is not documented**: The provided documentation does not include mod_security, its directives, or its configuration.
- **No equivalent built-in feature**: There is no mention of a built-in Apache module that provides generic request filtering for XSS or SQL injection.
- **No configuration or test instructions**: Without documentation for mod_security, it is not possible to provide configuration steps, test cases, or expected outcomes.

---

**Conclusion:**  
A security oracle for "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Injection Protection (mod_security)" cannot be generated from the provided documentation, as the necessary module and its features are not present or described. If you provide documentation for mod_security or a similar WAF module, a security oracle can be created.
