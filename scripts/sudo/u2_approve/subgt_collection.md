# Collect the Subgt

We already generate subgt-extract in build through subgt.json,
but you can try to reproduce the target we collect

rm -rf log/subgt-extract
mkdir log/subgt-extract

## Input 0
address_log generated by AFL dryrun
```
$SACK/AFL/afl-fuzz -c ./log/sack.conf -d -m 100M -i ./input/ -o ./output/ -t 1000+ -- ./sudo.fuzz ls /root
```
when started, press Ctrl + C


## Input 1
as test
vim /etc/sudo.conf and uncomment Plugin python_approval line to enable approve plugin
./sudo.fuzz ls /root

mv log/address_log log/subgt-extract/fail


## Input 2
as test
vim /etc/sudo.conf and comment Plugin python_approval line to disable approve plugin
./sudo.fuzz ls /root
test (correct passwd)

mv log/address_log log/subgt-extract/success

## Input 3
as root
vim /etc/sudo.conf and uncomment Plugin python_approval line to enable approve plugin
./sudo.fuzz ls /root

mv log/address_log log/subgt-extract/fail2

## Input 4
as root
vim /etc/sudo.conf and comment Plugin python_approval line to enable approve plugin
./sudo.fuzz ls /root

mv log/address_log log/subgt-extract/success2

remember to uncomment after collecting input 4


then, the system is able to run,
to see the collected subgt clearly,
you can use :
python3 address_to_json.py --address-dir ./log/subgt-extract/ --line-log log/line_log --func-map log/func_map --output merged_icalls.json
